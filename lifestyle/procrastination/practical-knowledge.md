# Practical knowledge

## Week plan

Don't use any new tools! Simply adopt your calendar/to-do tool for planning your tasks.

Parkinson's law — work will take whole planned time. Plan less time, work will take less time.

Timeboxing — write every thing into your calendar, even mundane things like sleeping etc.

Use schedule view to know exactly what you should do now!

Implementation intention — probability of doing something is bigger when the time is specified.

## Project planning

Focus on projects that are huge and consists of multiple sub-tasks.

Rules:
1. Determine boundaries (when project is good enough) — this way you'll kill your inner perfectionist. You can write this down.
2. Schedule deadline — if you won't do this, Parkinson's law will work.
3. Shorten your deadline by half! Add exact hour to your deadline!
4. Divide your project into stages:
    * Start with the last stage.
    * Ask yourself, can you finish tomorrow?
    * If not, what do I need to do to accomplish this?
    * Determine stage, can you do this tomorrow?
    * And so on... (do this until you'll find first step).
    * Add deadlines to all steps!
5. Divide into even smaller steps! Small things are easier to start.

Do not use any tools for this! Only simplest ones!

## Process vs result

Don't fix on a result, try to like a process. You have no influence over result, people might not like your work.

This is the result trap! Concentrate on a process. Don't think how epic your work will become, try to do something shitty — you'll fix it later.

## The habit of starting

Zeigarnik effect occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled. It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

The Ovsiankina effect is the tendency to pick up an interrupted action again when it has still not been achieved. It is named after its researcher, Maria Ovsiankina.

The effect states that an interrupted task, even without incentive, values as a “quasi-need”. It creates intrusive thoughts, aimed at taking up the task again.

So doing breaks will motivate you to return to tasks — and to do them even stronger!

The Best way to overcome work resistance is to work in short intervals. Even two minutes might do the work if resistance is strong.

Procrastination — inability to start tasks, it doesn't mean you need to finish something! You need to begin doing something!

Don't assume you're going to finish something, simply start doing anything.

## Knowledge in action!

1. Prepare a list of task.
    * It should contain not that tasks you're avoiding. Simply camouflage hard tasks among others.
2. Categorize your tasks.
3. There should be more tasks that you can accomplish — write down everything in each category (use any software you like).
4. Use timer:

__Important!__ Always do break after planned time.

__Important!__ Change category after each task.

__Important!__ If you finish any task do not overthink what's next! Simply do next task in line.

__Important!__ Do your break after work time, do not think about finishing task. Time is your imperative!

__Important!__ If you're feeling tired, simply reset set to 1.

__Important!__ If you're trained enough, you can switch short sets to standard _Pomodoro_ model. It's important to train your brain to start tasks.

__Important!__ If you've finished task during one stage, go to next from the same category.
