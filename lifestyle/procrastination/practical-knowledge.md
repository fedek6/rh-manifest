# Practical knowledge

## Week plan

Don't use any new tools! Simply adopt your calendar/to-do tool for planning your tasks.

Parkinson's law — work will take whole planned time. Plan less time, work will take less time.

Timeboxing — write every thing into your calendar, even mundane things like sleeping etc.

Use schedule view to know exactly what you should do now!

Implementation intention — probability of doing something is bigger when the time is specified.

## Project planning

Focus on projects that are huge and consists of multiple sub-tasks.

Rules:
1. Determine boundaries (when project is good enough) — this way you'll kill your inner perfectionist. You can write this down.
2. Schedule deadline — if you won't do this, Parkinson's law will work.
3. Shorten your deadline by half! Add exact hour to your deadline!
4. Divide your project into stages:
    * Start with the last stage.
    * Ask yourself, can you finish tomorrow?
    * If not, what do I need to do to accomplish this?
    * Determine stage, can you do this tomorrow?
    * And so on... (do this until you'll find first step).
    * Add deadlines to all steps!
5. Divide into even smaller steps! Small things are easier to start.

Do not use any tools for this! Only simplest ones!

## Process vs result

Don't fix on a result, try to like a process. You have no influence over result, people might not like your work.

This is the result trap! Concentrate on a process. Don't think how epic your work will become, try to do something shitty — you'll fix it later.
