## What is procrastination?

* Procrastination is the biggest force on the earth;
* Procrastination is not the cause, it's the symptom;
* Procrastination is caused by a prehistoric mechanism in a human brain;

“The choice is not working or not working, but which type of work; even feeling guilty because of procrastinating takes some effort. ... When you procrastinate, you're choosing a self-punishing form of work.”

The only cure for not doing something is to do something :)

### Tip

You can write down your current procrastination causes. This will pull subconscious mechanisms to your consciousness. 

## Good procrastination

Sometimes you need to postpone one task to do other one.

“You can do anything, but you can't do everything”

It's better to do one important thing than a thousand stupid ones.

### Tip

Choose what's important to you. Conscious decision will help you to cope with dismissed tasks. 

## Must & should

If you must do something it will, must certainly, cause blockage. If you must do something, you don't have control over your life. So you should avoid things that you must do.

You should think more about how do you form your tasks. Because, if you want to do something, you'll probably will. You should choose to do something instead of forcing it.

### Tip

Try to catch all “must” in your everyday tasks.

## Fears & anxieties

You might be afraid both success and failure.

* Fear = you know what might happen to you.
* Anxiety = it's source is unknown.


### Tip

If you're feeling afraid, ask yourself: what worse might happen? Can I do something to avoid this outcome? If you can do something about that, simply do it — if not, just don't think about it.

## Resistance & ego

Resistance — everyone has it. Procrastination means resistance. You need to accept it. Don't fight with it. 

Ego — it's made for protection of self-made yourself. It will deceive that planning is actually doing something. Your plans as dreams are safe, they won't need any actual skills from you.

Just talking instead of doing anything is lot easier.

Intention will not build anything! Only actions can do something. Ego gives you a feeling that everybody watches your work — it's like an imagined audience.

No one watches you! It's only your ego! 

Resistance is a compass to things important to you. 

You need to work despite the resistance!

Steven Pressfield categorization:

_Amateur_
* Avoid defeat & critique.
* Thinks that everything will go without any problems.

_Pro_
* Does not take his failure personally.
* Knows that everything will take him twice the time he planned.

## Perfectionism

Real perfectionism is a torment. Doing something perfect is really hard. You might fuck something up, if you're doing something for the first time, you'll get better by time — so don't overthink it. 

Because of your perfectionism, you're not doing new things, and you're doing endless tasks.

* Perfection is unreachable (by definition)!
* Perfectionism & ego loves each other!

Endless planning for a perfect project is just a method to run away from the real work. 

## Important & big projects

You should always do your lists. But you need to do it correctly! Divide your projects into multiple small tasks.

Almost every bug you do is fixable. You should not stress so much about quality of your work, this generates a lot of fears.

It's good to have multiple projects in different fields of life — be careful too much won't make you any better!
