Here are five ideas you can use to find your first customers.\n    \n  \n\n\n\nBy default, the outer div is display: block, but by adding the md:flex utility, it becomes display: flex on medium screens and larger.\nWhen the parent is a flex container, we want to make sure the image never shrinks, so we've added md:flex-shrink-0 to prevent shrinking on medium screens and larger. Technically we could have just used flex-shrink-0 since it would do nothing on smaller screens, but since it only matters on md screens, it's a good idea to make that clear in the class name.\nOn small screens the image is automatically full width by default. On medium screens and up, we've constrained that width to a fixed size using md:w-48.\n\nMobile first\nBy default, Tailwind uses a mobile first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap.\nWhat this means is that unprefixed utilities (like uppercase) take effect on all screen sizes, while prefixed utilities (like md:uppercase) only take effect at the specified breakpoint and above.\nWarning! Do not use sm to target mobile, use unpreffixed classes.\nFor this reason, it's often a good idea to implement the mobile layout for a design first, then layer on any changes that make sense for sm screens, followed by md screens, etc\nTargeting a single breakpoint\nHere is an example where the background color is red at the md breakpoint, but teal at every other breakpoint:\n\n  \n\n\nCustomizing breakpoints\n// tailwind.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  theme: {\n    screens: {\n      'tablet': '640px',\n      // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }\n\n      'laptop': '1024px',\n      // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }\n\n      'desktop': '1280px',\n      // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }\n    },\n  }\n}\n\nHover, Focus, & Other States\n\n  \n  \n    Sign up\n  \n\n\n\n  Hover me\n\n\n\n  New Project\n  Create a new project from a variety of starting templates.\n\n\nAttention: Check docs for more.\nFirst, last etc.\n\n  \n    {{ item }}\n  \n\n\n\n  \n    {{ item }}\n  \n\n\nGlobal styles\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nor:\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  h1 {\n    @apply text-2xl;\n  }\n  h2 {\n    @apply text-xl;\n  }\n}\n\nOr using plugin:\n// tailwind.config.js\nconst plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    plugin(function({ addBase, theme }) {\n      addBase({\n        'h1': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.2xl') },\n        'h2': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.xl') },\n        'h3': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.lg') },\n      })\n    })\n  ]\n}\n\n@font-face\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  @font-face {\n    font-family: Proxima Nova;\n    font-weight: 400;\n    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/400-regular.woff) format(\"woff\");\n  }\n  @font-face {\n    font-family: Proxima Nova;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/500-medium.woff) format(\"woff\");\n  }\n}\n\nExtracting components\n\n  Click me\n\n\n\n  .btn-indigo {\n    @apply py-2 px-4 bg-indigo-500 text-white font-semibold rounded-lg shadow-md hover:bg-indigo-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-400 focus:ring-opacity-75;\n  }\n\n\nAdding utilites\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n  .scroll-snap-none {\n    scroll-snap-type: none;\n  }\n  .scroll-snap-x {\n    scroll-snap-type: x;\n  }\n  .scroll-snap-y {\n    scroll-snap-type: y;\n  }\n}\n\nand if you want responsive variants:\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n  @variants responsive {\n    .scroll-snap-none {\n      scroll-snap-type: none;\n    }\n    .scroll-snap-x {\n      scroll-snap-type: x;\n    }\n    .scroll-snap-y {\n      scroll-snap-type: y;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nand dark mode:\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n  @variants dark {\n    .filter-none {\n      filter: none;\n    }\n    .filter-grayscale {\n      filter: grayscale(100%);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nState variants\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer utilities {\n  @variants hover, focus {\n    .filter-none {\n      filter: none;\n    }\n    .filter-grayscale {\n      filter: grayscale(100%);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n"},"css/notes-on-grids.html":{"url":"css/notes-on-grids.html","title":"Notes On Grids","keywords":"","body":"Notes on grids\ncolumn-start - column-end example\nThis way we're creating a 6 columns grid without gutters.

If it does reading flow will be broken.\n\n\n\nGeneral terms\n\nAccent is a diacritical mark near or through a letter for example \"ó\";\nAxis is a real or imaginary line on which letterform rotates;\nBaseline is a line upon which the letters appear to rest;\nBowls are round or elliptical forms that are the basic body shapes of letters, for example, C, G, O and b, c, e, or o;\nCap height is the height of uppercase letters;\nCounter is the white space enclosed in a letterform;\nCrossbar is a horizontal stroke that connects two strokes in capital letters (H for example);\nDrop Cap is large initial capital in a paragraph; \nGlyph is every character in the typeface;\nLigatures are conjoined letters;\nMajuscule is a capital letter;\nTerminal is an end of a stroke that does not include serif;\nx-height is the height of the lowercase letters (exemplified by x).\n\nTips and tricks\n\nSet font-size to 62.5% and you'll get one em amounting exactly 10px (it's easier to calculate);\nUse em units to calculate proportions between fonts;\n30 to 50 ems can be seen as ideal line length;\nAlways try to maintain a vertical rhythm. You can use this formula to calculate a heading line-height: basic line-height/heading font-size = heading line-height;\n\nA word about vertical rhythm\nVertical rhythm is not always possible, especially when dealing with multiple images of various sizes, however, it's still and admirable goal.\nHierarchy and Scale\nA size of the text elements should be based on a typographic scale (and importance). It might be a traditional scale:\n6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72\nOr the Fibonacci:\n16, 24, 40, 64, 104\nAlso, you can use a generator. \nInteresting fact: Some people set a font size to 0.625 em (62,5%) for easier calculations based on a 10px size.\nParagraphs\nParagraphs are punctuation of ideas. The single-line boundary is the most common paragraph delimiter. \nIf you use the indent, convention suggests that paragraphs that follow a heading or sub-heading should not be indented. Also you should not indent lines of text after lists and block quotes. \nA simple trick to accomplish that is use of an adjacent selector:\np { \n    text-indent: 2.5em; \n}\n\nh1 + p, \nh2 + p, \nh3 + p {\n    text-indent: 0;\n}\n\nDrop cap (versal)\nA drop cap is a large first letter in the first paragraph. \nOutdent cap\nAn outdent cap is the first letter outside of a text.\nMake the first line small caps\nThere is a trick to turn the first line of a text to small caps (or do whatever you want with it).\np::first-line {\n    font-variant: small-caps;\n}\n\nCheck this article, here you can learn more about first lines in typography.\nRight type\nImportant: The most important criterion is the context in which the typeface will be used and the purpose it will serve.\nFor enacted narratives, we can read the text beforehand, understand its meaning, tone and nuances. But what do wee do for emergent narratives? \nLook at the brand and environment. Imagine the context in which text will be read. Choose a type that enriches the meaning of the text but faes into the background rather than clamors for attention.\nWorkhorse fonts\nWorkhorse typefaces have sturdy features: conventional and easy recognizable letterforms, generous letter spacing, solid serifs, clear open counters, a tall x-height and ink traps. \nTheir character isn't overbearing or evocative so they capable of setting many different kinds of content.\nDisplay typefaces\nA display typeface is intended for use at large sizes for headings, rather than for longer passages of body text.\nDisplay category on Google Fonts\nWorkhorse typefaces are more flexible than display typefaces. To some extent, one can wear hiking shoes to a posh reception. If you combine them with casual jeans and stylish shirt and jacket, you might get away with it, just as workhorse typefaces might look acceptable in headlines if you adapt their spacing and use them with in combination with the right design elements. But you wouldn't climb a mountain in dancing shoes. Never use display typefaces for body text.\nFont quality checks\n\nCheck them at 100 to 150 points,\nCheck italics readability,\nCheck small caps clarity,\nCheck word rococo;\nCheck word lol0;\nCheck words floria and Eigenschaft for proper ligatures.\n\nSans or serif? ... Or monospace or cursive?\nFamiliar letterforms. Choose a face with customary shapes. Avoid quirky typefaces. Never set body copy in all capitals or all small-caps. Be careful with italics and obliques (and other variations). Choose a font whose ascenders for letters such as \"b\" and \"d\" rise above x-height, and vice-versa for \"p\" and \"q\". \nTrue fonts, not synthetics! Use only these fonts that have designed other variants such as bold and italics.\nGenerous x-height. Fonts designed for the screen have a generous x-height (you can check this on x letter).\nComfortable letter spacing. Should be good without CSS fixing.\nComfortable word spacing. Same as above.\nDetails\nCombining serif and sans-serif is a popular trick. But you must remember that both fonts must have the same x-height.\nWidows & orphans\n\nA widow is a paragraph ending line that falls at the beginning of the following page/column.\n\nAn orphan is a word, part of a word, or very short line that appears by itself at the end of a paragraph.\n\n\n\nIn simple words: be careful with a single words in the end of a paragraph and a short sentences in new columns.\nEmphasis\nUse only one type of emphasis. Select from bold, small caps, italics, type size, color and other typeface. \n\nHanging punctuation\nAlways pull your punctuation outside the text.\n\nNotice: For hanging punctuation, you can use negative text-indent value.\n\nAmpersand with style\nIt's a good idea to use special font for ampersands to make them more decorative.\nDo not use hyphen for em dash\nYou should always use &#8212 for text an interruption. \n\nAlways use proper quotes\nQuote chars depend on a language that you use. \nYou can style quotes using this CSS:\n:lang(en-us) > q {\n    quotes: \"\\2018\" \"\\2019\" \"\\201c\" \"\\201d\";\n}\n\nNotice: These: \" are called dumb quotes.\nTreat text as a user interface\nIf you want your content to convey a function as well as a meaning and to help your users understand how they are supposed to achieve they goal with your text, you'll have to include subtle visual cues. \nQuotes\n\nBlock quote is used for long quotations that are apart from the main body. This refers external source or other article. \n\n is used for inline quotations. It might be used  instead of quotation marks (add them using CSS).\n\n is used when you reference externally sourced quotes.\n\n\nHyphens and special chars\n\n- hyphen is not a minus char − or dash —. It's used to wrap words. There is soft hyphen &#173; and hard hyphen that is always visible.\n\n– — en and em dash are used to indicate range for example: (2.00 – 3.00 p.m.) or group (Meyer–Stevenson Lexicon).\n\n— em dash has 1em of width, and it's used to interrupt a sentence I was debugging the style sheet — wait a second what was he saying?. Some dashes benefit from having spaces around them; for instance, the em dash can be surrounded by a thin (&#8201;) or hair (&#8202;) space.  \n\nA single prime (′) should be used to represent feet and minutes, and double prime (″) for inches and seconds. \n\nUse ellipsis (&#8230) instead of triple periods. \n\n\n"},"design-rules/typography/font-weight-number-name.html":{"url":"design-rules/typography/font-weight-number-name.html","title":"Font Weight Number Name","keywords":"","body":"Font weight number to name\n100: Thin, Hairline, Ultra-light, Extra-light\n200: Light\n300: Book\n400: Regular, Normal, Plain, Roman, Standard\n500: Medium\n600: Semi-bold, Demi-bold\n700: Bold\n800: Heavy, Black, Extra-bold\n900: Ultra-black, Extra-black, Ultra-bold, Heavy-black, Fat, Poster\n"},"design-rules/ui-design-bootcamp/composition/composition.html":{"url":"design-rules/ui-design-bootcamp/composition/composition.html","title":"Composition","keywords":"","body":"UI design Bootcamp\nJohn Constable - first painter that used advanced composition.\nFirst think about composition!

Content is more important than the design that supports it. \n\nUsers don't read; they scan. When they analyze web page, they search for some fixed points or anchors that can guide them through content.\n\nWeb users are impatient and insist on instant gratification. The higher the cognitive load needed by users to process the website and less intuitive the navigation, the more likely they will leave you. \n\nUsers don't always make the best choices. Users choose whatever \"satisfices\" (satisfy + suffice). They choose the first reasonable option that presents itself. \n\nUsers follow their intuition. In most cases users will not read instructions. They will try to find something that works. \n\nUsers want to have control. They want to be able to control their browser and rely on consistently presented data. For example, they don't like popups, and they want to use \"Back\" button to return to a website that they just visited. \n\n\nUse a Clean and Consistent Visual Design\nYou should create a website that looks great, and requires no brain to learn :)\nCertain elements belong in certain places\nWebsites should be designed like newspapers, users should predict where to find certain elements. \nExample of common conventions\n\nWebsite's header is linked to the home page, and it's displayed in the top-left of a website. \n\nTaglines or secondary headlines are usually located in a proximity to, and bellow, a website's header.\n\nSearch boxes are located in the top-right or top-center of a website.\n\nIf website as an RSS subscription, user will look for it in top-right of the page.\n\n\nSearch must be easy\n\nA search box must be a box.\n\nThere must be a button do perform search. \n\nAdvanced search options must be hidden.\n\nSearch box should be placed on top–center or top–right part of your website — remember that users use the F shaped scanning pattern.\n\n\nLink rules\n\nColor is not enough to tell a user that something is a link — use also underlining. \n\nNon-clickable elements never ever should look like links!\n\nBe consistent with styling links.\n\nStyle different states of links. Users should know which are active, hovered and visited.\n\n\nUse drop-downs only when necessary\n\nLinks in dropdowns have low visibility.\n\nWhen a drop-down menu has to many options, user need to scroll to what might interest him.\n\nDrop-down are not the first thing users intuitively look for as way to navigate. \n\nAvoid more than one level of navigation!\n\n\nNotice: mega drop-down menus work well. Consider them if you have a lot of navigation stuff on page.\nAdd back to top link\nAvoid polluting browsers history using this type of link. It should be purely JS solution without anchors!\nAvoid links in a new window\nFrom a usability standpoint, forcing links to open in a new window violates one of the fundamental principles of UI design: users should always be in control of the interface.\nUseful navigation\nShould have levels:\n\nGlobal navigation: moves you from section to section.\n\nLocal navigation: moves you in the current section. This is a gateway to content.\n\nContextual navigation: moves you in the current page (it's like a table of contents).\n\nSupplemental navigation: after exploring a page of your website, many users will visit another one. This type of navigation includes related content and invites readers to stay with you. This might also be a breadcrumb navigation — popular in e-commerce and complicated applications (this also may encourage users, that get to you using Google, to visit category view).\n\n\nImportant usability rules and principles\n7±2 Principle\nHuman brain is limited in its capacity. It deals with complexity by dividing information into chunks and units. Humans can retain only about five to nine things in their short-term memory. This is an argument for limiting navigation items to seven (to 9). \n2-Second rules\nUser should not wait more than two seconds for response. The less users have to wait, the better will be the experience.\n3-Click rule\nUsers stop searching if they aren't able to find it in three clicks. More clicks are OK if users always know where they are and where they can go.\n80/20 Rule (Pareto)\n80% of effects comes from 20% of causes. You can maximize your income if you identify the 20% of your most important users.\nEight golden rules of interface design\n\nStrive for consistency.\nAllow frequent users to use shortcuts.\nOffer informative feedback.\nDesign dialogs to yield closure. \nOffer simple error handling.\nPermit easy reversal of actions.\nImpart a sense of control. Support an internal locus of control.\nReduce short-term memory load.\n\nFitts' Law\nTime required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. The law claims that there is a speed-accuracy trade off associated with pointing, whereby target that are smaller/or further away require more time to acquire. The principle encourages content to be positioned in areas that maximize their accessibility and improve click rates.\nInverted Pyramid\nIt puts summary at the very top of the article. It is essentially “waterfall effect”, well-known in journalism, whereby writers give their readers an instant picture of the topic they're reporting about. The article begins with the conclusion, followed by the key points and minor details, such as background information. Because Web users want instant gratification, it improves the user experience.\nGive Users a high view of your application\nLet's look at some ways you can convey your website's goals.\nMental models and metaphor\nMental model is a person’s thought of how something works.\nBefore they use a product, they imagine how to operate it according to their experience. And they use it based on that expectation. If the behavior of the product doesn’t meet the users’ mental model, it will confuse them. Therefore, we should design products to fit our user’s mental models.\nThere are two ways to have them match:\n\nShow the concept and features by metaphor. Metaphor in GUI is to use objects in the real world on software. For example, a screen looking like a bookshelf.\n\nShow the usage by idioms. Idioms in GUI are idiomatic expressions as visual language or patterns of interaction. For example, a list screen and its behavior. Clicking an item in the list takes users to the item’s detail screen. Many people can use this type of list screen because they have already learned this pattern.\n\n\nNotice: Shopping cart is a metaphor — it's obvious that there's no real shopping cart behind the web app.\nOrganize your website's content\nA good place to start is with categorization, separating your content into semantically coherent groups. The ideal solution requires the least amount of overhead and is most useful to your users. To create a sensible categorization schema, develop a taxonomy based words and phrases that your audience would expect.\nAnother way to organize your content (and improve website's search results) is to make use of metadata.\nOffer a site map\nFor large websites, a map is a good way to orient users.\np. 148\n"},"design-rules/ux/ux-basics.html":{"url":"design-rules/ux/ux-basics.html","title":"Ux Basics","keywords":"","body":"UX basics\nBasics\n\nUser interface design isn't about how a product looks but how it works;\nFirstly design interface, then code your backend;\nClarity - good UI doesn't need manual;\nConcision - concise & clear at the same time;\nFamiliarity - for example icons representing real-life objects; \nResponsiveness - speed & feedback about application doings; \nConsistency - use same patterns for the whole app;\nEfficiency - an app should make your users more efficient;\nForgiveness - for example always show undo button.\n\nBuilding blocks of an interface\n\nLayout and positioning - make elements closer or further to show their's relationship.

One possible interpretations is that requirements and design phases do not need to be entirely documentation-driven and theoretical.

Layered Approach.\nYou should use “separation of concerns” principle. According to this, we should have different modules for addressing different concerns.\nFor example:\n\nClient request.\nBusiness logic + database manipulation.\nResponse.\n\nWhich really means:\n\nController → API routes / endpoints.\nService layer → business logic.\nData access layer → database operations.\n\n\nController layer\nHere API routes are defined. In the route handler functions, you can deconstruct the request object, pick the important data and pass them to the service layer.\n\nService layer\nHere your business logic lives. It contains a bunch of classes and methods that take singular responsibility and are reusable (S.O.L.I.D rule). This layer allows you to effectively decouple the processing logic form the routes.\n\nData access layer\nHere we talk to the database.\n2. Folder structure.\nCommon folder structure:\n   src\n      ├── app.js            app entry point\n      ├── /api                controller layer: api routes\n      ├── /config            config settings, env variables\n      ├── /services            service layer: business logic\n      ├── /models            data access layer: database models\n      ├── /scripts            miscellaneous NPM scripts\n      ├── /subscribers        async event handlers\n      └── /test             test suites\n3. Publisher Subscriber Models.\nThe Publisher/Subscriber model is a popular data exchange pattern in which there are two communicating entities - publishers and subscribers. Publishers (message senders) send out messages along specific channels without any knowledge of the receiving entities. Subscribers (message receivers), on the other hand express interest in one or more of these channels without any knowledge about publishing entities.\nBad practice:\nexport default class UserService() {\n\n      async function signup(user) {\n\n        // 1. Create user record\n        // 2. Generate auth key\n        // 3. Send confirmation email\n        // ...\n\n      }\n\n    }\n\nAnd refactored code:\n var events = require('events');\n      var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();\n\n      export default class UserService() {\n\n        async function signup(user) {\n          // emit 'signup' event\n          eventEmitter.emit('signup', user.data)\n        }\n\n      }\n\nMultiple subscribers:\n// email.js\n\n// ...\n\neventEmitter.on(\"signup\", async ({ data }) => {\n  // event listener\n  // send email\n});\n\n// ...\n\n// auth.js\n\n// ...\n\neventEmitter.on(\"signup\", async ({ data }) => {\n  // event listener\n  // generate auth key\n});\n\n// ...\n\n4. Clean code & readability.\n\nLinting & formatting — use ESlint with Prettier.\n\nChoose style guide. Google or Airbnb?\n\nAdd some comments (but not too much).\n\n\n5. Write Asynchronous Code (promises, async/await).\nTry not to create a callback hell. For this purpose you can use Promises API (ES6). From ES8 you can also use async/await syntax.\nBad example:\nfunction get_data() {\n  $.get(\"https://url.com/one\", () => {\n    $.get(\"https://url.com/two\", () => {\n      $.get(\"https://url.com/three\", (res) => {\n        console.log(res);\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n\nRefactored example:\nasync function get_data() {\n  // async function\n  await $.get(\"https://url.com/one\");\n  await $.get(\"https://url.com/two\");\n  let res = await $.get(\"https://url.com/three\");\n  console.log(res);\n}\n\n6. Configuration files and Environment Variables.\nSeparate your config vars:\n/config\n        ├── index.js\n        ├── module1.js\n        └── module2.js\nUse .env files:\n// app.js\n\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\n\nconsole.log(process.env.DB_HOST);\nconsole.log(process.env.DB_USER);\n\nCommon .env practice is to import all vars into one object:\n// config/database.js\n\nrequire(\"dotenv\").config();\n\nexport default {\n  host: process.env.DB_HOST,\n  user: process.env.DB_USER,\n  pass: process.env.DB_PASS,\n};\n\n7. Testing, logging & error handling.\nTest your code\nUnit tests form the foundation of most testing setups. Here, individual units/components are tested in isolation from the rest of the code to verify their correctness. This allows your code to be validated at the (logically) lower level to ensure that each of the internal components is working accurately, as expected.\nChoose between Mocha, Jest and Jasmine.\n// example.test.js\n\nconst assert = require(\"assert\");\n\ndescribe(\"Basic addition test\", () => {\n  it(\"should add up to 3\", () => {\n    assert.equal(2 + 1, 3);\n  });\n\n  it(\"should equal 8\", () => {\n    assert.equal(4 * 2, 8);\n  });\n});\n\nLog everything\nIf you are looking for more functionality and convenience for your logging setup, you can consider using third party logging libraries into your code. Some of the most common logging frameworks for Node.js are - Winston, Bunyan, and Morgan.\nCatching errors\nInstead of letting Node.js throw errors, interrupt code execution, even fail at times, we’d rather take charge of our application’s control flow by handling these error conditions. This is what we can achieve through exception handling using try/catch blocks. By empowering developers to programmatically manage such exceptions, it keeps things stable, facilitates easier debugging, and also prevents a poor end-user experience.\n8. Code compression & file size.\nFor example GZIP in Express:\nvar compression = require(\"compression\");\nvar express = require(\"express\");\nvar app = express();\napp.use(compression());\n\n9. Dependency injection\nDependency injection is a software design pattern that advocates passing (injecting) dependencies (or services) as parameters to our modules instead of requiring or creating specific ones inside them.\nBad example:\nconst Emoji = require(\"./Emoji\");\nconst YellowEmojis = require(\"./yellow-emojis\");\n\nasync function getAllEmojis() {\n  return YellowEmojis.getAll(); // 🌕 🌟 💛 🎗 🌼\n}\n\nasync function addEmoji(emojiData) {\n  const emoji = new Emoji(emojiData);\n\n  return YellowEmojis.addEmoji(emoji);\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  getAllEmojis,\n  addEmoji,\n};\n\nAfter refactor:\nconst Emoji = require(\"./Emoji\");\n\nfunction EmojisService(emojiColor) {\n  async function getAllEmojis() {\n    return emojiColor.getAll();\n  }\n\n  async function addEmoji(emojiData) {\n    const emoji = new Emoji(emojiData);\n\n    return emojiColor.addEmoji(emoji);\n  }\n\n  return {\n    getAllEmojis,\n    addEmoji,\n  };\n}\n\nmodule.exports = EmojisService;\n\n10. Third-party solutions. Don’t reinvent the wheel. Don’t be greedy either.\nAs a developer, it helps to be on the lookout for tools that make your life easier. Here are some popular Node.js libraries that can effectively enhance your coding workflows:\n\nNodemon, (automatically restarts application when code files are updated).\nGulp, Grunt, (automated task runners).\nWinston, (logging framework).\nAgenda (job scheduling). \nMoment (working with date & time).\n\nWhile these libraries and tools ease off a lot of the burden, it is important to be intelligent and responsible about every package that we import. We should be aware about the purpose, strengths and weaknesses of each package we import and ensure that we aren’t over-reliant on them.\n11. General rules.\n“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.” — Martin Golding\n\nDRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP).\n“Keep it simple, stupid” (KISS).\nSeparation of Concerns.\nYAGNI (You ain’t gonna need it).\nAvoid premature optimization.\nS.O.L.I.D programming principles.\nDependency injection.\n\n12. Use Application Monitoring Tools.\nFor large-scale applications in production, one of the main goals is to better understand how users interact with the application: about which routes or features are most commonly used, about the most commonly performed operations, etc. Also, there is a focus on evaluating performance metrics, quality issues, bottlenecks, common errors, etc. and using that information to make the necessary changes and improvements.\nThis is where application monitoring (APM) tools like ScoutAPM come into the picture. ScoutAPM allows you to constructively analyze and optimize your web app’s performance. \nUseful links\n\nNode Target Mapping.\n\n"},"js/Node.js/architecture.html":{"url":"js/Node.js/architecture.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nBased on this.\nFolder structure\n\napi — route controllers.\nconfig — env vars and configurations.\nmodels — db models.\nservices — business logic.\nsubscribers — event handlers.\napp.js — entry point.\nserver.js — server config.\n\nServer\nserver.js\nconst http = require('http');\nconst app = require('./app');\n\nconst port = process.env.PORT || 3000;\n\nconst server = http.createServer(app);\n\nserver.listen(port);\n\napp.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\n// routes\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n    res.status(200).json({\n        message: 'Hello world!!!'\n    });\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n\nResource routes\n/api/routes/books.js\n/**\n * GET request to /books\n */\nrouter.get('/', (req, res, next) => {\n    res.status(200).json({\n        message: 'All Books were fetched'\n    });\n});\n\n/**\n * GET request to /books/:id\n */\nrouter.get('/:id', (req, res, next) => {\n    res.status(200).json({\n        message: 'Book with id was fetch'\n    });\n});\n\nEnvironment variables\nAs programmers, we often underestimate the importance of organizing and configuring environment variables.  It is important that our apps work in various environments. This could be your colleagues’ computer, in a server, in a docker container, or in some other cloud provider. Therefore, setting up environment variables is crucial while architecting a Node.js application.\nUse dotenv package for environment management. \nIt is a good practice to gather our variables from .env file and map them into well-named variables and export them through a module. Let’s create a file config/index.js.\nconst dotenv = require('dotenv');\ndotenv.config();\nmodule.exports = {\n  endpoint: process.env.API_URL,\n  masterKey: process.env.API_KEY,\n  port: process.env.PORT\n};\n\nAnd use it:\nconst http = require('http');\nconst app = require('./app');\nconst { port } = require('./config');\n\nconst server = http.createServer(app);\n\nserver.listen(port);\n\nMVC\n\nModel components are responsible for application’s data domain. Model objects are responsible for storing, retrieving, and updating data from the database.\n\nIt is the user interface of our application. In most modern web applications, the view layer is usually replaced by another single page application, for example, a React.js or an Angular application.\n\nControllers\n\n\nmodels/author.js\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst authorSchema = mongoose.Schema({\n    _id: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n    name: { type: String, required: true },\n    books: { type: Object, required: false }\n});\nmodule.exports = mongoose.model('Author', authorSchema);\n\napi/controller/author.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    createAuthor: async (name) => {\n        const author = new Author({\n            _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\n            name: name\n        });\n        try {\n            const newAuthorEntry = await author.save()\n            return newAuthorEntry; \n        } catch (error) {\n            throw error\n        }\n    },\n\n    getAuthor: async (id) => {\n        // ..\n    },\n\n    getAllAuthors: async() => {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\napi/routes/author.js\n/**\n * POST create /author\n */\nrouter.post(\"/\", async (req, res, next) => {\n    const author = await authorController.createAuthor(req.body.name)\n    res.status(201).json({\n        message: \"Created successfully\",\n        author\n    })\n});\n\nNotice: Our components are now following the single responsibility principle.\nThis is all OK before we need to scale up our application:\napi/controller/author.js\ncreateAuthor: async (name) => {\n        const author = new Author({\n            _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\n            name: name\n        });\n        try {\n            // cehck if author is best-seller\n            const isBestSeller = await axios.get('some_third_part_url');\n            // if best seller do we have that book in our store \n            if(isBestSeller) {\n                // Run Additional Database query to figure our\n                //...\n                //if not send library admin and email \n                //...\n                // other logic and such\n            }\n            const newAuthorEntry = await author.save()\n            return newAuthorEntry; \n        } catch (error) {\n            throw error\n        }\n},\n\nIt looks messy! Controller is responsible for multiple actions, so it's breaking SRP.\nLayered Architecture for Node.js\nWe want to apply the separation of concerns principle and move our business logic away from our controllers. We will create small service functions that will be called from our controllers. This architecture is also referred to as a 3-layer-architecture.\nService function example:\ncreateAuthor: async (name) => {\n        const author = new Author({\n            _id: new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(),\n            name: name\n        });\n        try {\n            await AuthorService.checkauthorSalesStatus();\n            await BookService.checkAvailableBooksByAuthor(name);\n            const newAuthorEntry = await author.save();\n            return newAuthorEntry; \n        } catch (error) {\n            throw error\n        }\n},\n\nNotice that service functions are designed to do one specific task. This way, our services are encapsulated, testable, and open to future changes without any major side effects.\nExample\nThis looks bad:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst { mongoUrl } = require('./config');\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\n\n//routes \nconst authorsRoutes = require('./api/routes/authors');\nconst booksRoutes = require('./api/routes/books');\n\nmongoose.connect(mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true });\nmongoose.Promise = global.Promise;\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\napp.use((req, res, next) => {\n    res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\n    res.header(\n      \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\",\n      \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization\"\n    );\n    if (req.method === \"OPTIONS\") {\n      res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET\");\n      return res.status(200).json({});\n    }\n    next();\n});\n\napp.use('/authors', authorsRoutes);\napp.use('/books', booksRoutes);\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n\nSo let's extract config functions to external module:\nconfig/init.js\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\nconst { mongoUrl } = require('./index');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    initializeDB: async () => {\n        mongoose.connect(mongoUrl, { useNewUrlParser: true });\n        mongoose.Promise = global.Promise;\n    },\n\n    cors: async (req, res, next) => {\n        res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"*\");\n        res.header(\n        \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\",\n        \"Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, Authorization\"\n        );\n        if (req.method === \"OPTIONS\") {\n        res.header(\"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", \"PUT, POST, PATCH, DELETE, GET\");\n        return res.status(200).json({});\n        }\n        next();\n    }\n}\n\nAnd voilà:\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst bodyParser = require('body-parser');\nconst config = require('./config/init')\n\n//routes \nconst authorsRoutes = require('./api/routes/authors');\nconst booksRoutes = require('./api/routes/books');\n\n\napp.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\napp.use(bodyParser.json());\n\napp.use(config.cors);\n\napp.use('/authors', authorsRoutes);\napp.use('/books', booksRoutes);\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n\n"},"js/Phaser/phaser-ts.html":{"url":"js/Phaser/phaser-ts.html","title":"Phaser Ts","keywords":"","body":"Phaser 3 in TS\nBased on this.\nInitial steps\ndegit https://github.com/ourcade/phaser3-parcel-template.git .\nnpm install\nnpm install -g parcel-bundler\n\n"},"js/React/":{"url":"js/React/","title":"React","keywords":"","body":""},"js/React/Linaria/":{"url":"js/React/Linaria/","title":"Linaria","keywords":"","body":"Linaria\nLinaria in Webpack\n"},"js/React/patterns-practices/component-organization.html":{"url":"js/React/patterns-practices/component-organization.html","title":"Component Organization","keywords":"","body":"Component organization\n10 tips by Chris Achard\nSource: here.\n\nYou need to determine your own (your` team) way.\nAll components in src directory (imported images also should be there).\nShared components go to compoenents directory.\nClean it up later.

Use SRP rule! It states that every element should have responsibility for a specific, single part of the functionality provided by the application — not more and not less.\nArrange all components in a hierarchy (in larger projects it might be the ABEM).\nDetermine where your state lives. In general, it is recommended to have as few stateful components as possible.\n\nOrganizing\nHaving certain patterns throughout the building procedure really helps you in keeping the app manageable.\nProposed structure:\n\nElements — buttons, Icons, Inputs, etc. — all those are elements which are used over and over again. They are low-level items, reused in multiple components.\nComponents — there, a component has to fulfill a certain standalone function for the user or the app’s appearance. Therefore, it is not just an element. Elements, in contrast, doesn’t provide standalone functions. So whilst a search bar component allows the user to submit a search query, an input field alone won’t.\nContainers — containers are our state-managing components. They are at the very top of our hierarchy and usually consist of several components.\n\nBuilding\nUse official React guide:\n\nBuild a static version of your application.\nIdentify and implement the minimal state your app needs.\nAdd functions to mutate the state and thus make the UI interactive.\n\nStatic version\nAs a first step, we build a static version of the frontend which we outlined in the mockup. So do not think about any functionalities or state manipulations. First, we focus on designing the app. For that, we take every component we previously identified and implement it in our app. Since we don’t have any data to use at that point, we can temporarily use placeholders.\nState principles\nIn general, the state should be as lean as possible. Only add data to your state that is necessarily needed by your app and compute everything else on-demand.\nAsk yourself React questions!\nAbout mutations\nNever ever modify state directly!\nState updates might be asynchronous!\nHow to organize large scale apps\nSource: here.\nOrganize components thematically. For example, we have a folder named Profile that contains all the components related to the Profile page in an application, a folder named Cart that contains all the components related to the cart in the application.\nUse one naming convention. Author of this article likes small letters with dashes (user-profile.jsx for e.g.).\nAvoid large render methods. For example: let’s say we have a Profile component that renders user’s Profile, and if we add all the small components in our render method with several props then the render requires too much energy from the device and most probably it will perform slowly on several devices.\nWhile building large-scale React applications, you will find yourself writing a lot of code that has nothing to do with React, so at the time you find yourself in a situation like that you can simply move that logic out of your components. And you can create a folder as lib or services full of non-React components.\nIntroduced by Facebook, the Jest framework has been one of the best options for testing React applications. It’s really quick and good at handling lots of tests, runs in watch mode, and gives fast feedback with some handy functions for testing React applications out of the box.\n"},"js/React/patterns-practices/resilient-components.html":{"url":"js/React/patterns-practices/resilient-components.html","title":"Resilient Components","keywords":"","body":"Resilient components\nBased on this.\nLinting\n...is not most important.\nYou can always use eslint-config-react-app which has no style rules.\nDo not use linter for enforcing style! Prettier can do this better.\n1. Don't stop the data flow\nWhen somebody uses your component, they expect that they can pass different props to it over time, and that the component will reflect those change.\nfunction Button({ color, children }) {\n  return (\n    // ✅ `color` is always fresh!\n    {children}\n  );\n}\n\nBut often mistake is to copy prop into state:\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    color: this.props.color,\n  };\n  render() {\n    const { color } = this.state; // 🔴 `color` is stale!\n    return {this.props.children};\n  }\n}\n\n\nIn the rare case that this behavior is intentional, make sure to call that prop initialColor or defaultColor to clarify that changes to it are ignored.\n\nEven when calculation of such prop is costly, you shouldn't do this:\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    textColor: slowlyCalculateTextColor(this.props.color),\n  };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.children}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nThis component is buggy because it doesn’t recalculate this.state.textColor on the color prop change! You should move this code to a memoization hook:\nfunction Button({ color, children }) {\n  const textColor = useMemo(\n    () => slowlyCalculateTextColor(color),\n    [color] // ✅ Don’t recalculate until `color` changes\n  );\n  return (\n    \n      {children}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nDon’t Stop the Data Flow in Side Effects\nThis code is buggy:\nclass SearchResults extends React.Component {\n  state = {\n    data: null,\n  };\n  componentDidMount() {\n    this.fetchResults();\n  }\n  fetchResults() {\n    const url = this.getFetchUrl();\n    // Do the fetching...\n  }\n  getFetchUrl() {\n    return \"http://myapi/results?query\" + this.props.query;\n  }\n  render() {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nBecause it won't reflect prop changes. You should watch property changes using hooks or componentDiDupdate.\nBest solution for this problem is to use hooks:\nfunction SearchResults({ query }) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    function fetchResults() {\n      const url = getFetchUrl();\n      // Do the fetching...\n    }\n\n    function getFetchUrl() {\n      return \"http://myapi/results?query\" + query + \"&page=\" + currentPage;\n    }\n\n    fetchResults();\n  }, [currentPage, query]); // ✅ Refetch on change\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nBe very careful to respect all prop changes! \n\nDangers of optimization\nclass Button extends React.Component {\n  shouldComponentUpdate(prevProps) {\n    // 🔴 Doesn't compare this.props.onClick \n    return this.props.color !== prevProps.color;\n  }\n  render() {\n    const onClick = this.props.onClick; // 🔴 Doesn't reflect updates\n    const textColor = slowlyCalculateTextColor(this.props.color);\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.children}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nYou should avoid optimization by hand. It's better to use memo:\nfunction Button({ onClick, color, children }) {\n  const textColor = slowlyCalculateTextColor(color);\n  return (\n    \n      {children}\n    \n  );\n}\nexport default React.memo(Button); // ✅ Uses shallow comparison\n\n\nWhenever you use props and state, consider what should happen if they change. In most cases, a component shouldn’t treat the initial render and updates differently. That makes it resilient to changes in the logic.\n\n2. Always Be Ready to Render\nDon’t try to introduce unnecessary timing assumptions into your component behavior. Your component should be ready to re-render at any time.\nWarning! Once again avoid copying props into state. This is considered anti-pattern. \nYou can accomplish control using this example:\n// Option 1: Fully controlled component.\nfunction TextInput({ value, onChange }) {\n  return (\n    \n  );\n}\n\nOr this way:\n// Option 2: Fully uncontrolled component.\nfunction TextInput() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('');\n  return (\n     setValue(e.target.value)}\n    />\n  );\n}\n\n// We can reset its internal state later by changing the key:\n\n\n\nPureComponent, shouldComponentUpdate, and React.memo shouldn’t be used for controlling behavior. Only use them to improve performance where it helps. If removing an optimization breaks a component, it was too fragile to begin with.\n\nThe solution here is the same as we described earlier. Don’t treat “receiving props” as a special event. Avoid “syncing” props and state. In most cases, every value should either be fully controlled (through props), or fully uncontrolled (in local state). Avoid derived state when you can.\n3. Components aren't singletons\nSometimes we assume a certain component is only ever displayed once. Such as a navigation bar. This might be true for some time. However, this assumption often causes design problems that only surface much later.\nFor example resetting Redux store on component unmount might be a bad idea. One component can remove state used by other one.\n4. Isolate local state\nIf you’re not sure whether some state is local, ask yourself: “If this component was rendered twice, should this interaction reflect in the other copy?” Whenever the answer is “no”, you found some local state.\n\nPost content. We’d want editing the post in one tree to update it in another tree. Therefore, it probably should not be the local state of a Post component. (Instead, the post content could live in some cache like Apollo, Relay, or Redux.)\n\nList of comments. This is similar to post content. We’d want adding a new comment in one tree to be reflected in the other tree too. So ideally we would use some kind of a cache for it, and it should not be a local state of our Post.\n\nWhich comments are expanded. It would be weird if expanding a comment in one tree would also expand it in another tree. In this case we’re interacting with a particular Comment UI representation rather than an abstract “comment entity”. Therefore, an “expanded” flag should be a local state of the Comment.\n\nThe value of new comment input. It would be odd if typing a comment in one input would also update an input in another tree. Unless inputs are clearly grouped together, usually people expect them to be independent. So the input value should be a local state of the NewComment component.\n\n\n"},"js/React/patterns-practices/responsive-react.html":{"url":"js/React/patterns-practices/responsive-react.html","title":"Responsive React","keywords":"","body":"Responsive React\nThere are three approaches to implement responsiveness in React:\n\nMedia queries.\nInline styles.\nHigher order components.\n\nMedia queries in CSS\nPros\n\nRelatively simple to apply.\nAnyone with basic CSS skills can create and implement Media Queries.\n\nCons\n\nReact will render extra DOM elements, hidden by CSS, that are never used.\nCSS is external to the Component.\nAn additional import needed for the CSS file.\n\nInline styles\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\nfunction App() {\n  const [width, setWindowWidth] = useState(0)\n   useEffect(() => {\n\n     updateDimensions();\n\n     window.addEventListener(“resize”, updateDimensions);\n     return () =>\n       window.removeEventListener(“resize”,updateDimensions);\n    }, [])\n    const updateDimensions = () => {\n      const width = window.innerWidth\n      setWindowWidth(width)\n    }\n   //…rest of App.js below…\n}\n\nInline style logic:\nconst showNav = {\n  display: showTopNavMenu ? \"flex\" : \"none\",\n};\nconst showMenuIcon = {\n  display: showTopNavMenu ? \"none\" : \"flex\",\n};\nreturn (\n  <>\n    \n      {navMenuItems}\n    \n    \n  \n);\n\nPros\n\nResponsive design no longer depends on an external CSS file.\nThe Component is more self contained and reusable.\nCSS is scoped to this Component with less chance of conflicting CSS.\n\nCons\n\nConsiderably more work to implement than Media Queries.\nMedia Queries are more easily and intuitively read.\n\nHigher order components\nFor example, you can use React-Socks or react-responsive.\nimport { Breakpoint, BreakpointProvider } from ‘react-socks’;\nfunction App() {\n//...rest of App.js above....\nreturn (\n  \n    \n    \n  \n}\n\nAnd the logic:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nPros\n\nEasy to implement and configure\nClass names in Dev Tools are semantic and reflect the changes\n\nCons\n\nNoticed a small delay in removing/adding the nav elements\nDidn’t work on inline elements, such as spans, but that might be just a limitation for this library\nRequired changing inline elements to block or using divs instead of spans\n\n"},"js/React/Redux/":{"url":"js/React/Redux/","title":"Redux","keywords":"","body":"Redux\nWhen?\n\nYou have reasonable amounts of data changing over time.\nYou need a single source of truth for your state.\nYou find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient.\n\nRedux toolkit\nThis is recommended because:\nRTK includes utilities that help simplify many common use cases, including store setup, creating reducers and writing immutable update logic, and even creating entire \"slices\" of state at once.\n# NPM\nnpm install @reduxjs/toolkit\n\n# Yarn\nyarn add @reduxjs/toolkit\n\nOr by using create app:\nnpx create-react-app my-app --template redux\n\nRedux Core\n# NPM\nnpm install redux\n\n# Yarn\nyarn add redux\n\nBasic example\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\n\n/**\n * This is Reducer.\n * \n * The Redux state should contain only plain JS objects, arrays, and primitives.\n * The root state value is usually an object.

We use these, so we don't need to write action object every time.\nconst addTodo = text => {\n  return {\n    type: 'todos/todoAdded',\n    payload: text\n  }\n}\n\nReducers\nA reducer is a function that receives the current state and an action object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state: (state, action) => newState.\nRules of reducers:\n\nState can be calculated only by using state and action arguments.\nThey are not allowed to modify existing state. Instead, they must make immutable updates by copying state and making changes to copied values.\nThey can't do any asynchronous stuff or be random. \n\nReducer steps:\n\nCheck to see if the reducer cares about this action\nIf so, make a copy of the state, update the copy with new values, and return it\n\n\nOtherwise, return the existing state unchanged\n\nStore\nThe current Redux application state lives in an object called the store.\nDispatch\nThe only way to update the state is to call store.dispatch() and pass in an action object. \nYou can think of dispatching actions as “triggering an event” in the application. \nSelectors\nSelectors are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data.\nconst selectCounterValue = state => state.value\n\nconst currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())\nconsole.log(currentValue)\n\n"},"js/React/css-variables-for-react.html":{"url":"js/React/css-variables-for-react.html","title":"Css Variables For React","keywords":"","body":"CSS Variables for React Devs\nBased on this article.\nBasic example of CSS vars:\nhtml {\n  --color-text: black;\n  --color-background: lightgray;\n  --color-primary: rebeccapurple;\n  --gutter: 16px;\n}\np {\n  color: var(--color-text);\n  margin-bottom: var(--gutter);\n}\n.title {\n  color: var(--color-primary);\n}\n\nNotice: This is the same as using the :root pseudo-selector.\nStyled-components\nIn styled components it would be:\nimport { createGlobalStyle } from 'styled-components';\n// Create a `GlobalStyles` component.\n// I usually already have this, to include a CSS\n// reset, set border-box, and other global concerns.\nconst GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`\n  html {\n    --color-text: black;\n    --color-background: white;\n    --color-primary: rebeccapurple;\n  }\n`;\nconst App = ({ children }) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      \n      {children}\n    \n  );\n};\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background: var(--color-primary);\n`;\n\nGlobal responsiveness\nCheck this example:\nconst GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`\n  html {\n    --min-tap-target-height: 48px;\n    @media (min-width: ${(props) => props.theme.bp.desktop}) {\n      --min-tap-target-height: 32px;\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  height: var(--min-tap-target-height);\n`;\nconst TextInput = styled.input`\n  height: var(--min-tap-target-height);\n`;\n\nNow you need to declare breakpoints only in one place!\nFonts example:\nconst GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`\n  html {\n    --font-size-small: 16px;\n    --font-size-medium: 22px;\n    @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      --font-size-small: 21px;\n      --font-size-medium: 24px;\n    }\n  }\n`;\n// Elsewhere...\nconst Paragraph = styled.p`\n  font-size: var(--font-size-small);\n`;\nconst OpeningParagraph = styled.p`\n  font-size: var(--font-size-medium);\n`;\n\nAnimate any CSS property\nIf you animate CSS variables, instead of properties, you can animate everything!\nInteroperate with JS\nIf you need to access your variables in JS, you could store them somewhere and:\nconst GlobalStyles = createGlobalStyle`\n  html {\n    --color-text: ${COLORS.text};\n    --color-background:  ${COLORS.background};\n    --color-primary:  ${COLORS.primary};\n  }\n`;\n\nOr read them:\ngetComputedStyle(document.documentElement).getPropertyValue('--color-primary');\n\nOr set them:\n// Try changing the value of this CSS variable,\n// and check out the blog's logo!\ndocument.documentElement.style.setProperty(\n  '--color-primary',\n  'hsl(245deg, 100%, 60%)'\n);\n\nAll of that said: If type-safety is a must-have, you don't have to give it up!

Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. (We don’t recommend rewriting your existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new ones if you’d like.)\nThese are reasons to use hooks:\n\nWith Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community,\n\nHooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a reducer to make it more predictable,\n\nHooks let you use more of React’s features without classes. Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques,\n\n\nUsing hooks\nsetState hook\nWe use useState which is a hook. This way React will preserve this local state between re-renders. useStat returns a pair: the current state and a function to update it. \nAttention: useState in a contradiction to this.setState does not merge new and old states. \nThe only argument passed to useState is an initial value of a state.\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call \"count\"\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    \n      You clicked {count} times\n       setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nYou can use useState multiple times:\nfunction ExampleWithManyStates() {\n  // Declare multiple state variables!\n  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);\n  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);\n  // ...\n}\n\nEffect Hook\nYou’ve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations “side effects” (or “effects” for short) because they can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering.\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Update the document title using the browser API\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    \n      You clicked {count} times\n       setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\nThis works similar to componentDidUpdate. It will change the document title after a component update.\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction FriendStatus(props) {\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);\n\n  function handleStatusChange(status) {\n    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\n  }\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);\n    return () => {\n      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);\n    };\n  });\n\n  if (isOnline === null) {\n    return 'Loading...';\n  }\n  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';\n}\n\nIn this example, React would unsubscribe from our ChatAPI when the component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render. (If you want, there’s a way to tell React to skip re-subscribing if the props.friend.id we passed to ChatAPI didn’t change.)\nAttention You can use more than one useEffect in one component.\nfunction FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n  });\n\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);\n    return () => {\n      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);\n    };\n  });\n\n  function handleStatusChange(status) {\n    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\n  }\n  // ...\n\nRules\n\nHooks should be called only at the top level. Do not call them in loops etc.\nOnly call them from function components. \n\nUse linter rules to enforce proper usage of hooks:\nnpm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev\n\nAnd add it to .eslintrc.js:\n{\n  \"extends\": [\n    // ...\n    \"plugin:react-hooks/recommended\"\n  ]\n}\n\nCustom hooks\nCustom hooks let you to write less code.  \nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction useFriendStatus(friendID) {\n  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);\n\n  function handleStatusChange(status) {\n    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);\n  }\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\n    return () => {\n      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);\n    };\n  });\n\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nUsage:\nfunction FriendListItem(props) {\n  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);\n\n  return (\n    \n      {props.friend.name}\n    \n  );\n}\n\nThe state of each component is completely independent. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each call to a Hook has a completely isolated state — so you can even use the same custom Hook twice in one component.\nCustom Hooks are more of a convention than a feature. If a functions name starts with ”use” and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The useSomething naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the code using Hooks.\nYou can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven’t considered. We are excited to see what custom Hooks the React community will come up with.\nOther common hooks\n\nuseContext - lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting,\nuseReducer - lets you manage a local state of complex components with a reducer.\n\nMultiple values in a state\nTo avoid additional renders of a component, you can store more values in one state. You can do it jut  like this:\nconst [state, setCounters] => useState({ counterA: 0, counterB: 0 });\n\nreturn (\n  <>\n     setCounters({ ...state, counterA: counerA + 1 }); }>A\n     setCounters({ ...state, counterB: counerB + 1 }); }>B\n    {state.CounterA}\n    {state.CounterB}\n  \n);\n\nYou can also create two state values:\nconst [counterA, setCounterA] => useState(0);\nconst [counterB, setCounterB] => useState(0);\n\nreturn (\n  <>\n     setCounterA(prevCount => prevCount + 1); }>A\n     setCounterB(prevCount => prevCount + 1); }>B\n    {counterA}\n    {counterB}\n  \n);\n\nYou can also emulate class components behaviour:\nsetState(prevState => {\n  // Object.assign would also work\n  return {...prevState, ...updatedValues};\n});\n\n"},"js/React/react-context-api.html":{"url":"js/React/react-context-api.html","title":"React Context Api","keywords":"","body":"React context API\nContext provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.\nIn a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but this can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.\nContext is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.\nTheme toggling example\nYou can create /context folder and place there your context files.

Simply use SRP (single responsibility principle). If component does more than one thing, it should be decomposed into smaller ones.\nCreate hierarchy for your components.\nBuild a static version using React\nBuild your app without any interactivity. For static version do not use state! State is used only for interactivity. \nComponent at the top of the hierarchy will take data model as prop. \nIdentify the minimal representation of UI state\nUse DRY principle (don't repeat yourself). Figure out absolute minimal representation of application needs. \nFor example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array.\nFigure which data is state. Ask three questions:\n\nIs it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.\nDoes it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.\nCan you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.\n\nIf something is changed over time and can't be computed from anything it is state! For example search box inside a component can be state. \nIdentify a place for your state\nRemember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand, so follow these steps to figure it out:\n\nIdentify every component that renders something based on that state.\nFind a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).\nEither the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.\nIf you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.\n\nAdd Inverse Data Flow\nIf you try to type or check the box in the current version of the example, you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable.\nSince components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated.\n"},"js/React/useful-resources.html":{"url":"js/React/useful-resources.html","title":"Useful Resources","keywords":"","body":"Useful resources\nUpdating React Context inside child components\nConditional rendering\n4 Examples of the useState Hook\n"},"js/snippets/array.html":{"url":"js/snippets/array.html","title":"Array","keywords":"","body":"Array\nRandom array element\n//#Source https://bit.ly/2neWfJ2 \nconst sample = arr => arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];\nconsole.log(sample([3, 7, 9, 11]));\n\n"},"js/snippets/chrome.html":{"url":"js/snippets/chrome.html","title":"Chrome","keywords":"","body":"Chrome\nEnable interactive design mode\ndocument.designMode = 'on';\n\n"},"js/snippets/numbers.html":{"url":"js/snippets/numbers.html","title":"Numbers","keywords":"","body":"Numbers\nLarge number separator\n// easier to read\nconst readableBillion = 1000_000_000;\nconsole.log(readableBillion) // returns 1000000000\n\n"},"js/snippets/object.html":{"url":"js/snippets/object.html","title":"Object","keywords":"","body":"Object\nIterate through keys and entries\n// using entries to get key and value both\nObject.entries(person).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n  console.log(`${key} is ${value}`);\n});\n\n"},"js/snippets/operators.html":{"url":"js/snippets/operators.html","title":"Operators","keywords":"","body":"Operators\nLogical Assignment Operator\n&&=\na &&= b;\n\n// Equals to\nif (a) {\n  a = b\n}\n\n||=\na ||= b;\n\n// Equals to\na || (a = b);\n\n??=\na ??= b;\n\n// the above statement is equivalent to\nif (a === null || a === undefined) {\n  a = b;\n}\n\n"},"js/snippets/regex.html":{"url":"js/snippets/regex.html","title":"Regex","keywords":"","body":"Regex\nReplace all occurrences\nThere's a new function to replace all occurrences:\nstr.replaceAll('-', ' '); // Red Green Blue\n\nThis way you don't need to use the g modifier.\n"},"js/Strapi/":{"url":"js/Strapi/","title":"Strapi","keywords":"","body":"Strapi Notes\nCreating starter app\nStrapi (back)\nBased on this tutorial.\nyarn create strapi-app backend --quickstart --template https://github.com/strapi/strapi-template-blog\n\nWill create backend directory with the Strapi app. \nIf you want to use GraphQL in your project:\nyarn strapi install graphql\n\nPlayground will be automatically added: http://localhost:1337/graphql\nStrapi vanilla (back)\nUse docker-compose:\nversion: '3'\n\nservices:\n  strapi:\n    container_name: strapi\n    image: strapi/strapi\n    environment:\n      - DATABASE_CLIENT=postgres\n      - DATABASE_HOST=db\n      - DATABASE_PORT=5432\n      - DATABASE_NAME=strapi\n      - DATABASE_USERNAME=strapi\n      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=strapi\n    ports:\n      - 1337:1337\n    volumes:\n      - ./app:/srv/app\n    depends_on:\n      - db\n\n  db:\n    container_name: postgres\n    image: postgres\n    restart: always\n    volumes:\n      - ./db:/var/lib/postgresql/data\n    environment:\n      POSTGRES_USER: strapi\n      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: strapi\n      POSTGRES_DB: strapi\n\nAdd GraphQL:\ndocker -ps\ndocker exec -it [id] bash\nyarn strapi install graphql\n\nAnd you got playground: http://localhost:1337/graphql\nSlug system\nSimply add a text field (slug) and set it up to be non-editable.\nAdd Strapi function config/functions/slugify.js.\nAlso edit model code:\nmodule.exports = {\n  lifecycles: {\n    beforeCreate: async (data) => {\n      if (data.title) {\n        data.slug = strapi.config.functions['slugify'].slugifyInternational(data.title);\n      }\n    },\n    beforeUpdate: async (params, data) => {\n      if (data.title) {\n        data.slug = strapi.config.functions['slugify'].slugifyInternational(data.title);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nNext.js (front)\nyarn create next-app --typescript frontend\n\nyarn add @apollo/client graphql\n\n"},"js/Strapi/strapi-faker.html":{"url":"js/Strapi/strapi-faker.html","title":"Strapi Faker","keywords":"","body":"Strapi faker\nUse this repo.\nSet plugin privileges.\nAfter finishing configuration, go to:\nhttp://localhost:1337/strapi-faker/up\nAnd it will populate automatically.\n"},"js/styled-components/":{"url":"js/styled-components/","title":"Styled Components","keywords":"","body":"Basics of styled-components\nstyled-components utilizes tagged template literals so it removes the mapping between components and styles. This means that you're creating React component when creating styles.\nSimple example:\n// Create a Title component that'll render an  tag with some styles\nconst Title = styled.h1`\n  font-size: 1.5em;\n  text-align: center;\n  color: palevioletred;\n`;\n\n// Create a Wrapper component that'll render a  tag with some styles\nconst Wrapper = styled.section`\n  padding: 4em;\n  background: papayawhip;\n`;\n\n// Use Title and Wrapper like any other React component – except they're styled!\nrender(\n  \n    \n      Hello World!\n    \n  \n);\n\nAdapting based on props\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  /* Adapt the colors based on primary prop */\n  background: ${props => props.primary ? \"palevioletred\" : \"white\"};\n  color: ${props => props.primary ? \"white\" : \"palevioletred\"};\n\n  font-size: 1em;\n  margin: 1em;\n  padding: 0.25em 1em;\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    Normal\n    Primary\n  \n);\n\nExtending styles\nTo easily make a new component that inherits the styling of another, just wrap it in the styled() constructor. Here we use the button from the last section and create a special one, extending it with some color-related styling:\n// The Button from the last section without the interpolations\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  color: palevioletred;\n  font-size: 1em;\n  margin: 1em;\n  padding: 0.25em 1em;\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n`;\n\n// A new component based on Button, but with some override styles\nconst TomatoButton = styled(Button)`\n  color: tomato;\n  border-color: tomato;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    Normal Button\n    Tomato Button\n  \n);\n\nChanging HTML tag assigned to the styled component\nFor that you'll need as polymorphic prop:\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  display: inline-block;\n  color: palevioletred;\n  font-size: 1em;\n  margin: 1em;\n  padding: 0.25em 1em;\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  display: block;\n`;\n\nconst TomatoButton = styled(Button)`\n  color: tomato;\n  border-color: tomato;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    Normal Button\n    Link with Button styles\n    Link with Tomato Button styles\n  \n);\n\nThis is is some serious mambo-jumbo magic:\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  display: inline-block;\n  color: palevioletred;\n  font-size: 1em;\n  margin: 1em;\n  padding: 0.25em 1em;\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n  display: block;\n`;\n\nconst ReversedButton = props => \n\nrender(\n  \n    Normal Button\n    Custom Button with Normal Button styles\n  \n);\n\nStyling any component\nYou can add styles to any third-party component, as long it passees classNam to a DOM element.\n// This could be react-router-dom's Link for example\nconst Link = ({ className, children }) => (\n  \n    {children}\n  \n);\n\nconst StyledLink = styled(Link)`\n  color: palevioletred;\n  font-weight: bold;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    Unstyled, boring Link\n    \n    Styled, exciting Link\n  \n);\n\nNotice: You can also pass tag names into the styled() factory call, like so: styled(\"div\"). In fact, the styled.tagname helpers are just aliases that do the same.\nPassed props\n// Create an Input component that'll render an  tag with some styles\nconst Input = styled.input`\n  padding: 0.5em;\n  margin: 0.5em;\n  color: ${props => props.inputColor || \"palevioletred\"};\n  background: papayawhip;\n  border: none;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n`;\n\n// Render a styled text input with the standard input color, and one with a custom input color\nrender(\n  \n    \n    \n  \n);\n\nNotice: Note how the inputColor prop is not passed to the DOM, but type and defaultValue are. That is styled-components being smart enough to filter non-standard attributes automatically for you.\nBigger example\nThis shows bigger dive into styling bigger components:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n\nconst StyledCounter = styled.div`\n  /* ... */\n`\nconst Paragraph = styled.p`\n  /* ... */\n`\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  /* ... */\n`\n\nexport default class Counter extends React.Component {\n  state = { count: 0 }\n\n  increment = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })\n  decrement = () => this.setState({ count: this.state.count - 1 })\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.state.count}\n        +\n        -\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nNotice: Note that we added a \"Styled\" prefix to StyledCounter so that the React component Counter and the Styled Component StyledCounter don't clash names but remain easily identifiable in the React Developer Tools and Web Inspector.\nWarning! Always create your styled-components before the render function. This way it will work a lot faster.\nPseudoelements, pseudoselectors, and nesting\nThe ampersand (&) can be used to refer back to the main component. Here are some more examples of its potential usage:\nconst Thing = styled.div.attrs((/* props */) => ({ tabIndex: 0 }))`\n  color: blue;\n\n  &:hover {\n    color: red; //  when hovered\n  }\n\n  & ~ & {\n    background: tomato; //  as a sibling of , but maybe not directly next to it\n  }\n\n  & + & {\n    background: lime; //  next to \n  }\n\n  &.something {\n    background: orange; //  tagged with an additional CSS class \".something\"\n  }\n\n  .something-else & {\n    border: 1px solid; //  inside another element labeled \".something-else\"\n  }\n`\n\nrender(\n  \n    Hello world!\n    How ya doing?\n    The sun is shining...\n    Pretty nice day today.\n    Don't you think?\n    \n      Splendid.\n    \n  \n)\n\nFinally, the ampersand can be used to increase the specificity of rules on the component; this can be useful if you are dealing with a mixed styled-components and vanilla CSS environment where there might be conflicting styles:\nconst Thing = styled.div`\n  && {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n`\n\nconst GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`\n  div${Thing} {\n    color: red;\n  }\n`\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n    \n      I'm blue, da ba dee da ba daa\n    \n  \n)\n\nAttaching additional props\nHere we render an Input component and attach some dynamic and static attributes to it:\nconst Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({\n  // we can define static props\n  type: \"text\",\n\n  // or we can define dynamic ones\n  size: props.size || \"1em\",\n}))`\n  color: palevioletred;\n  font-size: 1em;\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  border-radius: 3px;\n\n  /* here we use the dynamically computed prop */\n  margin: ${props => props.size};\n  padding: ${props => props.size};\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n);\n\nOverriding .attrs\nconst Input = styled.input.attrs(props => ({\n  type: \"text\",\n  size: props.size || \"1em\",\n}))`\n  border: 2px solid palevioletred;\n  margin: ${props => props.size};\n  padding: ${props => props.size};\n`;\n\n// Input's attrs will be applied first, and then this attrs obj\nconst PasswordInput = styled(Input).attrs({\n  type: \"password\",\n})`\n  // similarly, border will override Input's border\n  border: 2px solid aqua;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  \n    \n    \n    {/* Notice we can still use the size attr from Input */}\n    \n  \n);\n\nAnimations\nCSS animations with @keyframes aren't scoped to a single component but you still don't want them to be global to avoid name collisions. This is why we export a keyframes helper that will generate a unique instance that you can use throughout your app:\n// Create the keyframes\nconst rotate = keyframes`\n  from {\n    transform: rotate(0deg);\n  }\n\n  to {\n    transform: rotate(360deg);\n  }\n`;\n\n// Here we create a component that will rotate everything we pass in over two seconds\nconst Rotate = styled.div`\n  display: inline-block;\n  animation: ${rotate} 2s linear infinite;\n  padding: 2rem 1rem;\n  font-size: 1.2rem;\n`;\n\nrender(\n  &lt; 💅🏾 &gt;\n);\n\nCSS helper\nKeyframes are lazily injected when they're used, which is how they can be code-splitted, so you have to use the css helper for shared style fragments:\nconst rotate = keyframes``\n\n// ❌ This will throw an error!\nconst styles = `\n  animation: ${rotate} 2s linear infinite;\n`\n\n// ✅ This will work as intended\nconst styles = css`\n  animation: ${rotate} 2s linear infinite;\n`\n\nPotential usage example:\nimport styled, { css } from 'styled-components'\n\nconst complexMixin = css`\n  color: ${props => (props.whiteColor ? 'white' : 'black')};\n`\n\nconst StyledComp = styled.div`\n  /* This is an example of a nested interpolation */\n  ${props => (props.complex ? complexMixin : 'color: blue;')};\n`\n\nNotice: If you're interpolating a string, you do not need to use this, only if you're interpolating a function.\n"},"js/styled-components/good-practices.html":{"url":"js/styled-components/good-practices.html","title":"Good Practices","keywords":"","body":"Good practices\nBased on this article.\nUse CSS variables\nTo avoid performance hiccups, you should use CSS variables instead of interpolation (because it recreates class names etc.).\nThis way you can pass variables to component:\nfunction Backdrop({ opacity, color, children }) {\n  return (\n    \n      {children}\n    \n  )\n}\nconst Wrapper = styled.div`\n  opacity: var(--opacity);\n  background-color: var(--color);\n`;\n\nAlso you can use CSS variables to declare defaults:\nfunction Backdrop({ opacity, color, children }) {\n  return (\n    \n      {children}\n    \n  )\n}\nconst Wrapper = styled.div`\n  opacity: var(--opacity, 0.75);\n  background-color: var(--color, var(--color-gray-900));\n`;\n\nIf we call  without specifying an opacity or color, we'll default to 75% opaque, and our color theme's dark gray color.\nSingle source of styles\nLet's look on this simple component:\nconst TextLink = styled.a`\n  color: var(--color-primary);\n  font-weight: var(--font-weight-medium);\n`;\n\nBut what if you want to change the style of this component by context?\n\nYou can embed component into wrapper style:\n\n// Aside.js\nimport TextLink from '../TextLink'\nconst Aside = ({ children }) => { /* Omitted for brevity */ }\nconst Wrapper = styled.aside`\n  /* Base styles */\n  ${TextLink} {\n    color: var(--color-text);\n    font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);\n  }\n`;\nexport default Aside;\n\nAttention: It's wrong because it breaks the React encapsulation rule!

It natively has one call stack and one memory heap at its disposal. This seems to imply that all operations need to pass through that main thread and therefore wait for the preceding ones to have completed before they can get their chance.\nJS consists of:\nJavaScript Engine.\n\nBrowser Runtime Environment.\nCall Stack, Callback Queue, and Event Loop.\n\nWhen you call a function like setTimeout that would otherwise have been blocking in nature, after being pushed to the call stack, it is immediately transferred to the browser’s web APIs.\nOnce your setTimeout function is completed, it is pushed to (what is known as) the callback queue or the task queue. This queue stores the asynchronous tasks that have been completed before they are pushed back to the call stack to be finally executed.\nThe event loop is the last part of this equation that is responsible for pushing the items waiting in the callback queue to the main call stack. It closely monitors the call stack and the callback queue - when the call stack is empty, it picks the topmost item from the callback queue and pushes it to the call stack for execution.\nJS Promises\nTo make this easier, with ES 6 (ES 2015), Promises were introduced in JavaScript. They allowed more flexibility, better readability, and more control over how you wanted your asynchronous code to be handled.\nfunction get_data() {\n  $.get(\"https://url.com/one\") // chained using .then()\n    .then(() => $.get(\"https://url.com/two\"))\n    .then(() => $.get(\"https://url.com/three\"))\n    .then((res) => console.log(res));\n}\n\nAsync/Await\nWith ES 8 (ES 2017), the async/await syntax was introduced to simplify things even more. Async/await serves mostly as syntactic sugar on top of Promises, but has brought about a decent change in how code is written and in a bunch of other things that we’ll discuss later in the post.\nasync function get_data() {\n  // async function\n  await $.get(\"https://url.com/one\"); // execution pauses, waiting for request to complete\n  await $.get(\"https://url.com/two\");\n  let res = await $.get(\"https://url.com/three\");\n  console.log(res);\n}\n\nAdding await before a statement (inside an async function) makes JavaScript pause the execution inside the function and wait until that operation is completed.\nDeep dive into Promises\nPromises are JavaScript objects that represent an “eventual completion (or failure)” of some asynchronous code. It stands for an operation that hasn’t completed yet, but ‘promises’ to run asynchronously and return a value (or information about its failure) when it’s done.\n\nFulfilled — (i.e. successfully completed).\nRejected — (i.e. rejected, failed, or threw an error).\nPending — (i.e. still processing, working on it).\n\nThe Promises (or the Futures) API allows you to program your asynchronous behavior corresponding to each of these cases: you can capture the fulfillment case by using the .then() function and handle the rejections and thrown errors using the .catch() function.\nYou can create your custom promises:\nlet a = 1;\nvar myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  if (a > 0) {\n    resolve(a);\n  } else {\n    reject(\"My error message\");\n  }\n});\n\nmyPromise\n  .then((res) => {\n    // if promise is fulfilled\n    console.log(\"Promise was resolved ✅\");\n    console.log(\"Returned value:\", res);\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    // if promise fails\n    console.log(\"Some error occured! ⚠️\");\n    console.error(\"Error message: \", err);\n  });\n\nThe good thing about .then() and .catch() functions are that they also return promises.\n$.get(url1) // get url1\n  .then(() => $.get(url2)) // then url2\n  .then(() => $.get(url3)) // then url3\n  .then((res) => console.log(res)) // print response\n  .catch((err) => console.error(err)); // error handling\n\nDeep dive into Async/Await\nAsync functions are functions that return a promise. You can declare any function as an async function just by adding the ‘async’ keyword before it.\nasync function f() {\n  return \"Hello world! 🌎\";\n}\nconsole.log(f()); // prints the promise\nf().then((res) => console.log(res)); // prints returned value\n\nAwait statements\nNotice: We can use the await keyword only inside an async function.\nThis is more readable than the promise based code:\nasync function get_data() {\n  // using an async function\n  let url1 = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1\";\n  let url2 = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/1\";\n  let url3 = \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/1\";\n  await $.get(url1); // get url1\n  await $.get(url2); // then url2\n  let res3 = await $.get(url3); // then url3\n\n  console.log(res3); // print response\n}\n\nget_data();\n\nNotice: async/await is basically a wrapper on top of the Promises API.\nYou need to decide which is better\n$.get(url1)\n  .then((res1) => {\n    console.log(res1);\n    return $.get(doSomethingWithRes(res1, url2));\n  })\n  .then((res2) => {\n    console.log(res2);\n    return $.get(doSomethingWithRes(res2, url3));\n  })\n  .then((res3) => {\n    console.log(res3);\n  });\n\nVS.\nasync function myFunction() {\n  let res1 = await $.get(url);\n  console.log(res1);\n  let res2 = await $.get(doSomethingWithRes(url, res1));\n  console.log(res2);\n  let res3 = await $.get(doSomethingWithRes(url, res2));\n  console.log(res3);\n}\n\nSecond one has fewer lines, and it's easier to read.\nImportant note on error handling\nWhen using promises you need to add catch to your chain:\ntry {\n  $.get(url1)\n    .then(() => $.get(url2))\n    .then(function (res) {\n      throw new Error(\"Hello error! ⚠️\");\n    }); // throwing error to see if it’s caught\n  // uncomment below line ⬇️ to handle above thrown error\n  // .catch((err) => console.error('Handling error: ', err))\n} catch (err) {\n  // this won't be able to capture any errors that happen inside promises\n  console.error(err);\n}\n\nWhen using async/await you can do that:\nasync function myFunction() {\n  try {\n    await $.get(url1);\n    await $.get(url2);\n    throw new Error(\"Hello error! ⚠️\"); // throwing error to see if it’s caught\n  } catch (err) {\n    // this will be able to capture any errors that happen inside our async function\n    console.error(err);\n  }\n}\n\nAs we have seen in the last few sections, the advantages of async/await clearly outweigh those of promises.\n"},"lifestyle/procrastination/":{"url":"lifestyle/procrastination/","title":"Procrastination","keywords":"","body":"Procrastination\nThis course can be found here: https://pwlk.pl/kursy/antyprokrastynacja/\nWhat is procrastination?\n\nProcrastination is the biggest force on the earth;\nProcrastination is not the cause, it's the symptom;\nProcrastination is caused by a prehistoric mechanism in a human brain;\n\n“The choice is not working or not working, but which type of work; even feeling guilty because of procrastinating takes some effort. ...

Procrastination means resistance. You need to accept it. Don't fight with it. \nEgo — it's made for protection of self-made yourself. It will deceive that planning is actually doing something. Your plans as dreams are safe, they won't need any actual skills from you.\nJust talking instead of doing anything is lot easier.\nIntention will not build anything! Only actions can do something. Ego gives you a feeling that everybody watches your work — it's like an imagined audience.\nNo one watches you! It's only your ego! \nResistance is a compass to things important to you. \nYou need to work despite the resistance!\nSteven Pressfield categorization:\nAmateur\n\nAvoid defeat & critique.\nThinks that everything will go without any problems.\n\nPro\n\nDoes not take his failure personally.\nKnows that everything will take him twice the time he planned.\n\nPerfectionism\nReal perfectionism is a torment. Doing something perfect is really hard. You might fuck something up, if you're doing something for the first time, you'll get better by time — so don't overthink it. \nBecause of your perfectionism, you're not doing new things, and you're doing endless tasks.\n\nPerfection is unreachable (by definition)!\nPerfectionism & ego loves each other!\n\nEndless planning for a perfect project is just a method to run away from the real work. \nImportant & big projects\nYou should always do your lists. But you need to do it correctly! Divide your projects into multiple small tasks.\nAlmost every bug you do is fixable. You should not stress so much about quality of your work, this generates a lot of fears.\nIt's good to have multiple projects in different fields of life — be careful too much won't make you any better!\nDay structure — too much time\nMost people overestimate what they can do in one day and underestimate what day can do in one month.\n\nI'll do this tomorrow. \nI'll have more time tomorrow.\n\nYou don't have whole day! Remember that you can work about 6 hours every day.\nFight for free time\nYou do stupid things during working day, and you're feeling that you didn't finish your work — so you work after hours. \nYour brain wants immediate reward. That's why you use social media during working hours. \nWhat can you do? You should plan time for your entertainment before planning work. This is called reverse planning. \nYou should not rely on your motivation! You should always work when work need to be done.\nMotivation will show itself when you'll start working.\n"},"lifestyle/procrastination/practical-knowledge.html":{"url":"lifestyle/procrastination/practical-knowledge.html","title":"Practical Knowledge","keywords":"","body":"Practical knowledge\nWeek plan\nDon't use any new tools! Simply adopt your calendar/to-do tool for planning your tasks.\nParkinson's law — work will take whole planned time. Plan less time, work will take less time.\nTimeboxing — write every thing into your calendar, even mundane things like sleeping etc.\nUse schedule view to know exactly what you should do now!\nImplementation intention — probability of doing something is bigger when the time is specified.\nProject planning\nFocus on projects that are huge and consists of multiple sub-tasks.\nRules:\n\nDetermine boundaries (when project is good enough) — this way you'll kill your inner perfectionist. You can write this down.\nSchedule deadline — if you won't do this, Parkinson's law will work.\nShorten your deadline by half! Add exact hour to your deadline!\nDivide your project into stages:\nStart with the last stage.\nAsk yourself, can you finish tomorrow?\nIf not, what do I need to do to accomplish this?\nDetermine stage, can you do this tomorrow?\nAnd so on... (do this until you'll find first step).\nAdd deadlines to all steps!\n\n\nDivide into even smaller steps! Small things are easier to start.\n\nDo not use any tools for this! Only simplest ones!\nProcess vs result\nDon't fix on a result, try to like a process. You have no influence over result, people might not like your work.\nThis is the result trap! Concentrate on a process. Don't think how epic your work will become, try to do something shitty — you'll fix it later.\nThe habit of starting\nZeigarnik effect occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled. It postulates that people remember unfinished or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.\nThe Ovsiankina effect is the tendency to pick up an interrupted action again when it has still not been achieved. It is named after its researcher, Maria Ovsiankina.\nThe effect states that an interrupted task, even without incentive, values as a “quasi-need”. It creates intrusive thoughts, aimed at taking up the task again.\nSo doing breaks will motivate you to return to tasks — and to do them even stronger!\nThe Best way to overcome work resistance is to work in short intervals. Even two minutes might do the work if resistance is strong.\nProcrastination — inability to start tasks, it doesn't mean you need to finish something! You need to begin doing something!\nDon't assume you're going to finish something, simply start doing anything.\nKnowledge in action!\n\nPrepare a list of task.\nIt should contain not that tasks you're avoiding. Simply camouflage hard tasks among others.\n\n\nCategorize your tasks.\nThere should be more tasks that you can accomplish — write down everything in each category (use any software you like).\nUse timer:\n\nImportant! Always do break after planned time.\nImportant! Change category after each task.\nImportant! If you finish any task do not overthink what's next! Simply do next task in line.\nImportant! Do your break after work time, do not think about finishing task. Time is your imperative!\nImportant! If you're feeling tired, simply reset set to 1.\nImportant! If you're trained enough, you can switch short sets to standard Pomodoro model. It's important to train your brain to start tasks.\nImportant! If you've finished task during one stage, go to next from the same category.\n\nSet 1 (6 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n2 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n2 mins\n\n\nProjects\n2 mins\n\n\n\n\nSet 2 (20 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n5 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n5 mins\n\n\nProjects\n5 mins\n\n\nBreak\n5 mins\n\n\n\n\nSet 3 (35 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n10 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n10 mins\n\n\nProjects\n10 mins\n\n\nBreak\n5 mins\n\n\n\n\nSet 4 (50 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n15 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n15 mins\n\n\nProjects\n15 mins\n\n\nBreak\n5 mins\n\n\n\n\nSet 5 (65 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n20 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n20 mins\n\n\nProjects\n20 mins\n\n\nBreak\n5 mins\n\n\n\n\nSet 6 (80 mins)\n\n\n\nCategory\nTime\n\n\n\n\nAdmin\n25 mins\n\n\nFreelance\n25 mins\n\n\nProjects\n25 mins\n\n\nBreak\n5 mins\n\n\n\n"},"lifestyle/procrastination/project-template.html":{"url":"lifestyle/procrastination/project-template.html","title":"Project Template","keywords":"","body":"Project title\nInformation\nCriteria for finished project\n\nThree subpages ready.\nComment engine working.\n\netc.\nDeadline\ndd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:sss\nShort deadline\ndd-mm-yyyy hh:mm:sss\nStages\n(Start from the end and sort tasks after)\nResearch 📅 (dd-mm-yyyy - dd-mm-yyyy)\n\nMain task.\nSub-task.\nSub-task.\n\n\nSecond task.\nSub-task.\nSub-task.\n\n\n\nConfiguration 📅 (dd-mm-yyyy - dd-mm-yyyy)\n\nMain task.\nSub-task.\nSub-task.\n\n\nSecond task.\nSub-task.\nSub-task.\n\n\n\netc.\n"},"node/lerna.html":{"url":"node/lerna.html","title":"Lerna","keywords":"","body":"Lerna\n\nCreate repo, clone and yarn init.\nnpx lerna init.\nSet \"version\": \"independent\" in lerna.json (if you want to keep separate versions for your packages).\nBasic proposed configuration by Lerna team:\n\n{\n  \"packages\": [\n    \"packages/*\"\n  ],\n  \"version\": \"independent\",\n  \"npmClient\": \"yarn\",\n  \"command\": {\n    \"publish\": {\n      \"ignoreChanges\": [\"ignored-file\", \"*.md\"],\n      \"message\": \"chore(release): publish\",\n      \"registry\": \"https://npm.pkg.github.com\"\n    },\n    \"bootstrap\": {\n      \"ignore\": \"component-*\",\n      \"npmClientArgs\": [\"--no-package-lock\"]\n    }\n  } \n}\n\n\nEnable workspaces in package.json:\n\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"packages/*\"\n  ],\n\nand in lerna.json:\n\"useWorkspaces\": true\n\n\nAdd first package:\nCreate directory and Yarn init.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"@rh-ui/hello-world\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"author\": \"Konrad Fedorczyk\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\n  \"repository\": \"git://github.com/fedek6/rh-ui.git\",\n  \"main\": \"dist/index.js\",\n  \"module\": \"dist/index.js\",\n  \"source\": \"src/index.ts\",\n  \"types\": \"dist/index.d.ts\",\n  \"files\": [\n    \"dist\",\n    \"README.md\"\n  ],\n}\n\nWarning!

PSR-1 focuses on the basics, whereas PSR-2 expands upon PSR-1 and provides a more comprehensive coding style guide.\nOverview:\n\nFiles MUST use only \nFiles MUST use only UTF-8 without BOM for PHP code.\nFiles SHOULD either declare symbols (classes, functions, constants, etc.) or cause side effects(e.g. generate output, change .ini settings, etc.) but SHOULD NOT do both.\nNamespaces ad classes MUST follow PSR-0.\nClass names MUST be declared in StydlyCaps.\nClass constants MUST be declared in all upper case with underscore separators.\nMethod names MUST be declared in camelCase.\nProperties MAY use one of this methodologies (you must be consistient across your project):\n$StudlyCaps, \n$camelCase,\n$under_score.\n\n\n\nINFO: In all Realhe.ro projects I use $camelCase for all properties. \nExamples\n\nPSR-3 and PSR-7\nThese standards are associated with the code itself. \nPSR-3 is all about logging\nThis iteration of PSR contains information about LoggerInterface that should be implemented in all classes.\nFull specifications can be found here PSR-3.\nYou can use a standardized logger package.

That is, an underscore prefix explicitly has no meaning.\nThere MUST be a space between type declaration and property name.\n\nExample: \n\nMethods and Functions\n\nVisibility MUST be declared on all methods.\nMethod names MUST NOT be prefixed with a single underscore to indicate protected or private visibility. That is, an underscore prefix explicitly has no meaning.\nMethod and function names MUST NOT be declared with space after the method name. The opening brace MUST go on its own line, and the closing brace MUST go on the next line following the body. There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.\n\nMethod example:\n\nFunction example:\n\nMethod and Function Arguments\n\nIn the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.\nMethod and function arguments with default values MUST go at the end of the argument list.\n\nExample: \n\n\nArgument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line.\nWhen the argument list is split across multiple lines, the closing parenthesis and opening brace MUST be placed together on their own line with one space between them.\n\n\n\nWhen you have a return type declaration present, there MUST be one space after the colon followed by the type declaration. The colon and declaration MUST be on the same line as the argument list closing parenthesis with no spaces between the two characters.\n\nExample:\n\n\nIn nullable type declarations, there MUST NOT be a space between the question mark and the type.\n\n\n\nThere MUST NOT be a space between the variadic three dot operator and the argument name:\n\npublic function process(string $algorithm, ...$parts)\n{\n    // processing\n}\n\n\nWhen combining both the reference operator and the variadic three dot operator, there MUST NOT be any space between the two of them:\n\npublic function process(string $algorithm, &...$parts)\n{\n    // processing\n}\n\nabstract, final, and static\n\nWhen present, the abstract and final declarations MUST precede the visibility declaration.\n\nWhen present, the static declaration MUST come after the visibility declaration.\n\n\n\nMethod and Function Calls\n\nWhen making a method or function call, there MUST NOT be a space between the method or function name and the opening parenthesis, there MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis, and there MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis. In the argument list, there MUST NOT be a space before each comma, and there MUST be one space after each comma.\n\nbar($arg1);\nFoo::bar($arg2, $arg3);\n\n\nArgument lists MAY be split across multiple lines, where each subsequent line is indented once. When doing so, the first item in the list MUST be on the next line, and there MUST be only one argument per line. A single argument being split across multiple lines (as might be the case with an anonymous function or array) does not constitute splitting the argument list itself.\n\nbar(\n    $longArgument,\n    $longerArgument,\n    $muchLongerArgument\n);\n\nsomefunction($foo, $bar, [\n  // ...\n], $baz);\n\n$app->get('/hello/{name}', function ($name) use ($app) {\n    return 'Hello ' . $app->escape($name);\n});\n\nControl Structures\n\nThere MUST be one space after the control structure keyword\nThere MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis\nThere MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis\nThere MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the opening brace\nThe structure body MUST be indented once\nThe body MUST be on the next line after the opening brace\nThe closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body\nThe body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces.

The JavaScript Map, for example, is a general-purpose collection that stores key/value pairs. Because JavaScript has such a dynamic type system, a Map can be used to store any mix of data types using any mix of keys. \nprivate itemMap = new Map();\nGeneric type arguments\nThis map uses generic type arguments. The generic type arguments are enclosed in angle brackets (the  characters), and the Map here is given generic type arguments that tell the compiler that the Map will store TodoItem objects using number values as keys. \np. 14\nCheck this method for accessing to-do objects:\ngetTodoItems(includeComplete: boolean): TodoItem[] { \n    return [...this.itemMap.values()].filter(item => includeComplete || !item.complete);\n}\n\nThe TypeScript compiler uses the information it has been given to follow the types through each step. The generic type arguments used to create the Map tell the compiler that it contains TodoItem objects, so the compiler knows that the values method will return TodoItem objects and that this will also be the type of the objects in the array. Following this through, the compiler knows that the function passed to the filter method will be processing TodoItem objects and knows that each object will define a complete property.\nIf I try to read a property or method not defined by the TodoItem class, the TypeScript compiler will report an error.\nNotice: For building interactive console tools like to-do list from this chapter use the inquirer library.\nInteractive command tool example\nCheck this example of Inquirer prompt in TS:\nimport { TodoItem } from \"./todoItem\";\nimport { TodoCollection } from \"./todoCollection\"; import * as inquirer from 'inquirer';\nlet todos: TodoItem[] = [\n    new TodoItem(1, \"Buy Flowers\"), new TodoItem(2, \"Get Shoes\"),\n    new TodoItem(3, \"Collect Tickets\"), new TodoItem(4, \"Call Joe\", true)];\n\nlet collection: TodoCollection = new TodoCollection(\"Adam\", todos);\n\nfunction displayTodoList(): void { \n    console.log(`${collection.userName}'s Todo List `\n+ `(${ collection.getItemCounts().incomplete } items to do)`); \n    collection.getTodoItems(true).forEach(item => item.printDetails());\n}\nenum Commands { Quit = \"Quit\" }\n\nfunction promptUser(): void { \n    console.clear();\n    displayTodoList(); \n\n    inquirer.prompt({\n        type: \"list\",\n        name: \"command\",\n        message: \"Choose option\", \n        choices: Object.values(Commands)\n    }).then(answers => {\n        if (answers[\"command\"] !== Commands.Quit) { promptUser();\n    } })\n}\n\npromptUser();\n\nNotice: Enum is used here like a normal JS object. Look at this code Object.values(Commands). This is quite nifty way to extract values from TS's enum.\nAdding Type Declarations for the JavaScript Package\nThere are two ways to add declaration to used package:\n\nInstall them using npm install --save-dev @types/inquirer etc.\nType them yourself. \n\nIf you want to publish your types go here.\nType assertion\nlet completedTasks = answers[\"complete\"] as number[];\n\nEven with type definitions, there are times when TypeScript isn’t able to correctly assess the types that are being used. In this case, the Inquirer.js package allows any data type to be used in the prompts shown to the user, and the compiler isn’t able to determine that I have used only number values, which means that only number values can be received as answers. I used a type assertion to address this problem, which allows me to tell the compiler to use the type that I specify, even if it has identified a different data type (or no data type at all). When a type assertion is used, it overrides the compiler, which means that I am responsible\nfor ensuring that the type I assert is correct.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/002-js-primer.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/002-js-primer.html","title":"002 Js Primer","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Primer, Part 1\nNotice: To use autoreload in a node application use the nodemon package. \nFor example:\nnpx nodemon index.js\n\nJavaScript type handling is messy, for example:\nlet a = 100;\nlet b = \"100\";\n\n(a == b) ? true : false; // true\n\nlet sum = a + b; // 100100\n\nBuilt-in Types\n\nnumber — there's no difference between integer and floating-point values, number is a number.\nstring — text data.\nboolean\nnull — nonexistent or invalid reference.\nundefined — variable has been defined without value.\nobject — compound values, formed from individual properties and values.\n\nWarning: Running typeof on null variable will return object! This is prehistoric behavior. \nType coercion\nJS will try to convert incompatible variable to perform operations on them.\nThis is example of this:\nlet a = 100;\nlet b = \"100\";\n\nif (a == b)\n\nAvoiding coercion\nif (hatPrice === bootsPrice) {\n console.log(\"Prices are the same\");\n} else {\n console.log(\"Prices are different\");\n}\n\nlet totalPrice = Number(hatPrice) + Number(bootsPrice);\n\nThis can be useful…\nlet firstCity;\nlet secondCity = firstCity || \"London\";\n\nFunctions\nFunctions may produce different types based on their arguments. \nfunction sumPrices(first, second, third) {\n return first + second + third;\n}\n\nYou can avoid such problems using default parameters:\nfunction sumPrices(first, second, third = 0) {\n return first + second + third;\n}\n\nOr, even better, Rest Parameter:\nfunction sumPrices(...numbers) {\n return numbers.reduce(function(total, val) {\n    return total + val\n }, 0);\n}\n\nNotice: Rest Parameters is an array containing all the arguments for where parameter are not defined (it must be last in a function statement).\nYou can also filter out NaN values:\nfunction sumPrices(...numbers) {\n return numbers.reduce(function(total, val) {\n    return total + (Number.isNaN(Number(val)) ? 0 : Number(val));\n }, 0);\n}\n\nLambda, arrow or fat arrow functions…\nYou should use them whenever you pass a function as an argument:\nfunction sumPrices(...numbers) {\n return numbers.reduce((total, val) =>\n    total + (Number.isNaN(Number(val)) ? 0 : Number(val)));\n}\n\nNotice: The return keyword and curly braces are required only if the\narrow function needs to execute more than one statement.\nMore arrow notation!\nlet sumPrices = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((total, val) =>\n total + (Number.isNaN(Number(val)) ? 0 : Number(val)));\n\nWorking with arrays\nJavaScript arrays follow the approach taken by most programming languages, except they are dynamically resized and can contain any combination of values and, therefore, any combination of types. \nUseful array methods\n\nconcat(otherArray) — This method returns a new array that concatenates the array on which it has been called with the array specified as the argument. Multiple arrays can be specified\n\njoin(separator) — This method joins all the elements in the array to form a string. The argument specifies the character used to delimit the items.\n\npop() — This method removes and returns the last item in the array.\n\nshift() — This method removes and returns the first element in the array.\n\npush(item) — This method appends the specified item to the end of the array.\n\nunshift(item) — This method inserts a new item at the start of the array.\n\nreverse() — This method returns a new array that contains the items in reverse order.\n\nslice(start,end) — This method returns a section of the array.\n\nsort() — This method sorts the array. An optional comparison function can be used to perform custom comparisons.\n\nsplice(index, count) — This method removes count items from the array, starting at the specified index. The removed items are returned as the result of the method.\n\nevery(test) — This method calls the test function for each item in the array and returnstrue if the function returns true for all of them and false otherwise.\n\nsome(test) — This method returns true if calling the test function for each item in the array returns true at least once.\n\nfilter(test) — This method returns a new array containing the items for which the test function returns true.\n\nfind(test) — This method returns the first item in the array for which the test function returns true.\n\nfindIndex(test) — This method returns the index of the first item in the array for which the test function returns true.\n\nforEach(callback) — This method invokes the callback function for each item in the array, as described in the previous section.\n\nincludes(value) — This method returns true if the array contains the specified value.\n\nmap(callback) — This method returns a new array containing the result of invoking the callback function for every item in the array.\n\nreduce(callback) — This method returns the accumulated value produced by invoking the callback function for every item in the array.\n\n\nSpread operator\nThe spread operator can be used to expand the contents of an array so that its elements can be used as\narguments to a function.\nlet totalPrice = sumPrices(...prices);\n\nThe operator is used before the array name. The spread operator can also be used to expand the contents of an array for easy concatenation.\nlet combinedArray = [...names, ...prices];\ncombinedArray.forEach(element => console.log(`Combined Array Element: ${element}`));\n\nWorking with Objects\nJavaScript's objects are collections of properties, each of which has a name and a value.\nLiteral syntax:\nlet hat = {\n name: \"Hat\",\n price: 100\n};\n\nManipulating dynamic objects:\ngloves.name = gloves.productName;\ndelete gloves.productName;\ngloves.price = 20;\n\nGuarding Against Undefined Objects and Properties\nlet propertyCheck = hat.price || 0;\nlet objectAndPropertyCheck = (hat || {}).price || 0;\n\nUsing the Spread and Rest Operators on Objects\nThe spread operator can be used to expand the properties and values defined by an object.\nlet hat = {\n name: \"Hat\",\n price: 100\n};\n\nlet otherHat = { ...hat };\nlet additionalProperties = { ...hat, discounted: true};\n\nNotice: If a property name is used twice in the object literal syntax, then the second value is the one that will be\nused.\nDecomposition\nlet { price , ...someProperties } = hat;\n\nDefining Getters and Setters\nGetters and setters are functions that are invoked when a property value is read or assigned.\nlet hat = {\n name: \"Hat\",\n _price: 100,\n priceIncTax: 100 * 1.2,\n\n set price(newPrice) {\n   this._price = newPrice;\n   this.priceIncTax = this._price * 1.2;\n },\n\n get price() {\n   return this._price;\n }\n};\n\nhat.price = 120;\nconsole.log(`Hat: ${hat.price}, ${hat.priceIncTax}`);\n\nNotice: There are no private properties in the JavaScript. You can emulate this, but it's complicated. The best practice for pure JS code is to prefix variables with underscore _. \nDefining methods\nA method is a property whose value is a function, which means that all the features and behaviors that\nfunctions provide, such as default and rest parameters, can be used for methods. \nlet hat = {\n name: \"Hat\",\n _price: 100,\n priceIncTax: 100 * 1.2,\n writeDetails: function() {\n console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.price}, ${this.priceIncTax}`);\n }\n}\n\nYou can also use a concise method's syntax:\nwriteDetails() {\n console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.price}, ${this.priceIncTax}`);\n}\n\nUnderstanding the this Keyword\nThe this keyword can be confusing to even experienced JavaScript programmers. In other programming languages, this is used to refer to the current instance of an object created from a class. In JavaScript, the this keyword can often to appear to work the same way—right up until the moment a change breaks the application and undefined values start to appear.\nlet hat = {\n name: \"Hat\",\n _price: 100,\n priceIncTax: 100 * 1.2,\n\n set price(newPrice) {\n   this._price = newPrice;\n   this.priceIncTax = this._price * 1.2;\n },\n\n get price() {\n   return this._price;\n },\n\n writeDetails: () =>\n   console.log(`${this.name}: ${this.price}, ${this.priceIncTax}`)\n};\n\nhat.writeDetails(); // undefined: undefined, undefined\n\nUnderstating this in stand-alone functions\nfunction writeMessage(message) {\n console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${message}`);\n}\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nwriteMessage(\"It is sunny today\"); // Hello, It is sunny today\n\nJavaScript defines a global object, which can be assigned values that are available throughout an application. The global object is used to provide access to the essential features in the execution environment, such as the document object in browsers that allows interaction with the Document Object Model API.\nIn fact statement above is translated to:\nwriteMessage.call(window, \"It is sunny today\");\n\nAs explained earlier, functions are objects, which means they define methods, including the call method. It is this method that is used to invoke a function behind the scenes. The first argument to the call method is the value for this, which is set to the global object. This is the reason that this can be used in any function and why it returns the global object by default.\nNotice: The name of the global object changes based on the execution environment. In code executed by Node.js, global is used, but window or self will be required in browsers. At the time of writing, there is a proposal to standardize on the name global, but it has yet to be adopted as part of the JavaScript specification.\nImportant: JavaScript supports “strict mode,” which disables or restricts features that have historically caused poor-quality software or that prevent the runtime from executing code efficiently. When strict mode is enabled, the default value for this is undefined in order to prevent accidental use of the global object, and values with global scope must be explicitly defined as properties on the global object.\nIn fact, below code won't work:\n'use strict';\nfunction writeMessage(message) {\n console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${message}`);\n}\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nwriteMessage(\"It is sunny today\");\nwriteMessage.call(window, \"It is sunny today\");\n\nThis in methods\nlet myObject = {\n greeting: \"Hi, there\",\n writeMessage(message) {\n console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${message}`);\n }\n}\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nmyObject.writeMessage(\"It is sunny today\");\n\nThis, is in fact this:\nmyObject.writeMessage.call(myObject, \"It is sunny today\");\n\nBeware methods in variables:\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nlet myFunction = myObject.writeMessage;\nmyFunction(\"It is sunny today\");\n\nLocal object context will be replaced by global aka window!\nIn fact there's a way to fix this:\nmyObject.writeMessage = myObject.writeMessage.bind(myObject);\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nmyObject.writeMessage(\"It is sunny today\");\nlet myFunction = myObject.writeMessage;\nmyFunction(\"It is sunny today\");\n\nThis looks bad, but it works!\nUnderstanding this in Arrow Functions\nTo add to the complexity of this, arrow functions don’t work in the same way as regular functions. Arrow functions don’t have their own this value and inherit the closest value of this they can find when they are executed.\nlet myObject = {\n greeting: \"Hi, there\",\n getWriter() {\n  return (message) => console.log(`${this.greeting}, ${message}`);\n }\n}\n\ngreeting = \"Hello\";\nlet writer = myObject.getWriter();\nwriter(\"It is raining today\"); // Hi, there, It is raining today\nlet standAlone = myObject.getWriter; \nlet standAloneWriter = standAlone();\nstandAloneWriter(\"It is sunny today\"); // Hello, It is sunny today\n\nNotice: If you want to protect your code from this behavior use regular functions with bind protection.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/003-js-primer-2.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/003-js-primer-2.html","title":"003 Js Primer 2","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript Primer, Part 2\nUnderstanding JavaScript Object Inheritance\nJavaScript's objects have a link to another object, known as the prototype, from which they inherit properties and methods. Since prototypes are objects and have their own prototype, objects form an inheritance chain that allows complex features to be defined once and used consistently.\nWhen an object is created using the literal syntax, its prototype is Object, which is a built-in object provided by JavaScript.\nObject is the prototype for most objects, but it also provides some methods that are used directly, rather than through inheritance, and which can be used to get information about prototypes.\nUseful Object Methods\n\ngetPrototypeOf — This method returns an object’s prototype.\nsetPrototypeOf — This method changes the prototype of an object.\ngetOwnPropertyNames — This method returns the names of an object’s own properties.\n\nlet hatPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(hat);\nconsole.log(`Hat Prototype: ${hatPrototype}`);\nlet bootsPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(boots);\nconsole.log(`Boots Prototype: ${bootsPrototype}`);\n\nconsole.log(`Common prototype: ${hatPrototype === bootsPrototype}`); // true\nconsole.log(`Hat: ${hat.price}, ${hat.getPriceIncTax()}`);\nconsole.log(`toString: ${hat.toString()}`);\n\nChanging prototypes\nYou can modify objects prototype, but be careful, it's linked to other objects:\nlet hatPrototype = Object.getPrototypeOf(hat);\nhatPrototype.toString = function () {\n  return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n};\nconsole.log(hat.toString()); // Name: Hat, Price: 100\nconsole.log(boots.toString()); // Name: Boots, Price: 100\n\nBoth objects will have new prototypes function!\nCreating custom prototypes\nWarning! Do not change original Object. Create custom protoype whenever you can do it.\nlet ProductProto = {\n  toString: function () {\n    return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n  },\n};\n\nObject.setPrototypeOf(hat, ProductProto);\nObject.setPrototypeOf(boots, ProductProto);\nconsole.log(hat.toString());\nconsole.log(boots.toString());\n\nInheritance looks like this:\nhat/boots Using constructor functions\nA constructor function is used to create a new object, configure its properties, and assign its prototype, all of which is done in a single step with the new keyword. Constructor functions can be used to ensure that objects are created consistently and that the correct prototype is applied.\nNotice: constructor functions are simplified object definitions.\nConstructor functions are templates for creating objects. We can use it to create different objects using the same constructor, which has the same instance methods and properties with different values for the nonmethod properties\nlet Product = function (name, price) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.price = price;\n};\nProduct.prototype.toString = function () {\n  return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n};\nlet hat = new Product(\"Hat\", 100);\nlet boots = new Product(\"Boots\", 100);\n\nThis is little strange, but it looks like this because JS functions are in fact objects.\nChaining constructor functions\nUsing the setPrototypeOf method to create a chain of custom prototypes is easy, but doing the same thing with constructor functions requires a little more work to ensure that objects are configured correctly by the functions and get the right prototypes in the chain.\nlet Product = function (name, price) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.price = price;\n};\nProduct.prototype.toString = function () {\n  return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n};\nlet TaxedProduct = function (name, price, taxRate) {\n  Product.call(this, name, price);\n  this.taxRate = taxRate;\n};\nObject.setPrototypeOf(TaxedProduct.prototype, Product.prototype);\nTaxedProduct.prototype.getPriceIncTax = function () {\n  return Number(this.price) * this.taxRate;\n};\nTaxedProduct.prototype.toTaxString = function () {\n  return `${this.toString()}, Tax: ${this.getPriceIncTax()}`;\n};\n\nAccessing overridden prototype methods\nA prototype can override a property or method by using the same name as one defined further along the chain. This is also known as shadowing in JavaScript, and it takes advantage of the way that the\nJavaScript runtime follows the chain.\nCare is required when building on an overridden method, which must be accessed through the prototype that defines it.\nTaxedProduct.prototype.toString = function () {\n  let chainResult = Product.prototype.toString.call(this);\n  return `${chainResult}, Tax: ${this.getPriceIncTax()}`;\n};\n\nPrototype types\nTaxedProduct.prototype.getPriceIncTax = function () {\n  return Number(this.price) * this.taxRate;\n};\nTaxedProduct.prototype.toTaxString = function () {\n  return `${this.toString()}, Tax: ${this.getPriceIncTax()}`;\n};\nlet hat = new TaxedProduct(\"Hat\", 100, 1.2);\nlet boots = new Product(\"Boots\", 100);\n\nconsole.log(`hat and TaxedProduct: ${hat instanceof TaxedProduct}`);\nconsole.log(`hat and Product: ${hat instanceof Product}`);\nconsole.log(`boots and TaxedProduct: ${boots instanceof TaxedProduct}`);\nconsole.log(`boots and Product: ${boots instanceof Product}`);\n\nDefining static properties and methods\nProperties and methods that are defined on the constructor function are often referred to as static, meaning they are accessed through the constructor and not individual objects created by that constructor (as opposed to instance properties, which are accessed through an object). The Object.setPrototypeOf and Object.getPrototypeOf methods are good examples of static methods.\nDefining a Static Method:\nlet Product = function (name, price) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.price = price;\n};\n\nProduct.prototype.toString = function () {\n  return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n};\n\nProduct.process = (...products) =>\n  products.forEach((p) => console.log(p.toString()));\n\nProduct.process(new Product(\"Hat\", 100, 1.2), new Product(\"Boots\", 100));\n\nThe static process method is defined by adding a new property to the Product function object and assigning it a function. Remember that JavaScript functions are objects, and properties can be freely added and removed from objects. The process method defines a rest parameter and uses the forEach method to invoke the toString method for each object it receives and writes the result to the console.\nUsing JavaScript classes\nJavaScript' classes were added to the language to ease the transition from other popular programming languages. Behind the scenes, JavaScript classes are implemented using prototypes, which means that JavaScript classes have some differences from those in languages such as C# and Java.\nclass Product {\n  constructor(name, price) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.price = price;\n  }\n  toString() {\n    return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n  }\n}\nlet hat = new Product(\"Hat\", 100);\nlet boots = new Product(\"Boots\", 100);\n\nImportant: Classes are defined with the class keyword, followed by a name for the class. The class syntax may appear more familiar, but classes are translated into the underlying JavaScript prototype system described in the previous section.\nUsing inheritance\nClasses can inherit features using the extends keyword and invoke the superclass constructor and methods using the super keyword.\nclass Product {\n  constructor(name, price) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.price = price;\n  }\n  toString() {\n    return `toString: Name: ${this.name}, Price: ${this.price}`;\n  }\n}\nclass TaxedProduct extends Product {\n  constructor(name, price, taxRate = 1.2) {\n    super(name, price);\n    this.taxRate = taxRate;\n  }\n  getPriceIncTax() {\n    return Number(this.price) * this.taxRate;\n  }\n  toString() {\n    let chainResult = super.toString();\n    return `${chainResult}, Tax: ${this.getPriceIncTax()}`;\n  }\n}\n\nImportant: super is JavaScript' equivalent to PHP' parent::. It works the same.\nThe super keyword must be used before the this keyword and is generally used in the first statement in the constructor. The super keyword can also be used to access superclass properties and methods, like super.toString().\nDefining static methods\nThe static keyword is applied to create static methods that are accessed through the class, rather than the object it creates.\nclass TaxedProduct extends Product {\n  static process(...products) {\n    products.forEach((p) => console.log(p.toString()));\n  }\n}\n\nTaxedProduct.process(\n  new TaxedProduct(\"Hat\", 100, 1.2),\n  new TaxedProduct(\"Boots\", 100)\n);\n\nUsing iterators and generators\nIterators are objects that return a sequence of values.\nAn iterator defines a function named next that returns an object with value and done properties: the value property returns the next value in the sequence,\nand the done property is set to true when the sequence is complete\nfunction createProductIterator() {\n  const hat = new Product(\"Hat\", 100);\n  const boots = new Product(\"Boots\", 100);\n  const umbrella = new Product(\"Umbrella\", 23);\n  let lastVal;\n  return {\n    next() {\n      switch (lastVal) {\n        case undefined:\n          lastVal = hat;\n          return { value: hat, done: false };\n        case hat:\n          lastVal = boots;\n          return { value: boots, done: false };\n        case boots:\n          lastVal = umbrella;\n          return { value: umbrella, done: false };\n        case umbrella:\n          return { value: undefined, done: true };\n      }\n    },\n  };\n}\nlet iterator = createProductIterator();\nlet result = iterator.next();\nwhile (!result.done) {\n  console.log(result.value.toString());\n  result = iterator.next();\n}\n\nThe createProductIterator function returns an object that defines a next function. Each time the next method is called, a different Product object is returned, and then, once the set of objects has been exhausted, an object whose done property is true is returned to indicate the end of the data.\nUsing generators\nWriting iterators can be awkward because the code has to maintain state data to keep track of the current position in the sequence each time the next function is invoked. A simpler approach is to use a generator, which is a function that is invoked once and uses the yield keyword to produce the values in the sequence.\nfunction* createProductIterator() {\n  yield new Product(\"Hat\", 100);\n  yield new Product(\"Boots\", 100);\n  yield new Product(\"Umbrella\", 23);\n}\nlet iterator = createProductIterator();\nlet result = iterator.next();\nwhile (!result.done) {\n  console.log(result.value.toString());\n  result = iterator.next();\n}\n\nGenerator functions are created like that:\nfunction* createProductIterator() {\n\nGenerators are consumed in the same way as iterators. The JavaScript runtime creates the next function and executes the generator function until it reaches the yield keyword, which provides a value in the sequence.\nGenerators can be used with the spread operator, allowing the sequence to be used as a set of function\nparameters or to populate an array.\nfunction* createDumbIterator() {\n  yield \"I am\";\n  yield \"dumb\";\n  yield \"generator!\";\n}\n\nfunction appender(txt) {\n  let el = document.createElement(\"span\");\n  el.text = txt + \" \";\n  document.body.appendChild(el);\n}\n\nlet iterator = createDumbIterator();\nlet result = iterator.next();\n\nwhile (!result.done) {\n  result = iterator.next();\n  appender(result);\n}\n\nYou can also use spread operator:\n[...createProductIterator()].forEach((p) => console.log(p.toString()));\n\nNotice: yield is not available in ES6.\nIterable objects\nclass GiftPack {\n  constructor(name, prod1, prod2, prod3) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.prod1 = prod1;\n    this.prod2 = prod2;\n    this.prod3 = prod3;\n  }\n  getTotalPrice() {\n    return [this.prod1, this.prod2, this.prod3].reduce(\n      (total, p) => total + p.price,\n      0\n    );\n  }\n  90;\n  *getGenerator() {\n    yield this.prod1;\n    yield this.prod2;\n    yield this.prod3;\n  }\n}\n\nlet winter = new GiftPack(\n  \"winter\",\n  new Product(\"Hat\", 100),\n  new Product(\"Boots\", 80),\n  new Product(\"Gloves\", 23)\n);\nconsole.log(`Total price: ${winter.getTotalPrice()}`);\n[...winter.getGenerator()].forEach((p) => console.log(`Product: ${p}`));\n\nNotice: Using spread operator this way is little awkward.\nThis more elegant solution:\n  *[Symbol.iterator]() {\n    yield this.prod1;\n    yield this.prod2;\n    yield this.prod3;\n  }\n}\n\n[...winter].forEach(p => console.log(`Product: ${ p }`));\n\nI no longer have to invoke a method to get a generator, which produces clearer and more elegant code!\nJavaScript collections\nTraditionally, collections of data in JavaScript have been managed using objects and arrays, where objects are used to store data by key and arrays are used to store data by index.\nJavaScript also provides dedicated collection objects that provide more structure.\nStoring Data by Key Using an Object\nclass Foo {\n  constructor(bar) {\n    this.bar = bar;\n  }\n\n  toString() {\n    return `${bar}`;\n  }\n}\n\nlet data = {\n  foo: new Foo(\"bar\")\n}\n\ndata.bar = new Foo(\"foo\");\n\nObject.keys(data).forEach(key => console.log(data[key].toString()));\n\nYou can use:\n\nObject.keys(object) to get keys.\nObject.values(object) to get array of object` properties.\n\nStoring data by key using a map\nJavaScript also provides Map, which is purpose-built for storing data using keys of any type.\nlet data = new Map();\ndata.set(\"foo\", new Foo(\"foo\"));\ndata.set(\"bar\", new Foo(\"bar\"));\n\n[...data.keys()].forEach(key => console.log(data.get(key).toString()));\n\nCommon Map methods:\n\nset(key, value) Store value with a key.\nget(gey) Get value.\nkeys() Return iterator with the keys.\nvalues() Return iterator for the values.\nentries() Return iterator for the key and value (default one).\n\nUse symbols for map keys\nWarning! Symbol values can be useful, but they can be difficult to work with because they are not human readable and have to be created and handled carefully.\nclass FooSymbol {\n  constructor(name) {\n  this.id = Symbol();\n  this.name = name;\n }\n}\n\nlet setOne = [new FooSymbol(\"test\"), new FooSymbol(\"test2\")];\nlet setTwo = [new FooSymbol(\"test\"), new FooSymbol(\"test2\")];\n\nlet setMerged = new Map();\n\n[...setOne, ...setTwo].forEach(p => setMerged.set(p.id, p));\n\nThe benefit of using Symbol values as keys is that there is no possibility of two keys colliding. Using a Symbol allows me to store objects that have identical name and price properties and retrieve them without difficulty.\nStoring data by index\nJavaScript also provides Set, which stores data by index but has performance optimizations and—most usefully—stores only unique values.\nNotice: so Set is object like an array, but it has only unique values.\nclass FooSymbol {\n  constructor(name) {\n  this.id = Symbol();\n  this.name = name;\n }\n}\n\nconst bar = new FooSymbol(\"Test\");\nlet fooSet = new Set();\n\nfor (let i =  0; i \nCommon Set methods:\n\nadd(value) Add value to the set.\nentries() Returns iterator for the items.\nhas(value) Returns true if set has an element.\nforEach(callback) Function for each value in the Set.\n\nUsing modules\nThere is native JS support for modules. Node.js provides it only experimentally so remember to install ESM package.\nNodemon with ESM:\nnpx nodemon --require esm index.js\n\nCreating modules\nexport default function(price) {\n  return Number(price) * 1.2;\n}\n\nBy default, the contents of the JavaScript file are private and must be explicitly shared using the export keyword before they can be used elsewhere.\nThe default keyword is used when the module contains a single feature, such as the function. \nimport calcTax from \"./tax\";\ncalcTax(100);\n\nLocations\nimport calcTax from \"./tax\";\n\nWill search relative to module in which you're trying to import this module. But what if you omit period or periods in imported module` path?\nWell it will search by default in node_modules directory.\nimport React, { Component } from \"react\";\n\nNamed features\nexport function calculateTax(price) {\n  return Number(price) * 1.2;\n}\n\nAnd of course:\nimport { calculateTax } from \"./tax\";\n\n// Or mixed default + named\nimport calcTaxAndSum, { calculateTax } from \"./tax\";\n\nNotice: This is a common pattern with web application frameworks such as React, where the core features are provided by the default export of a module and optional features are available as named exports.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/004-typescript-compiler.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/004-typescript-compiler.html","title":"004 Typescript Compiler","keywords":"","body":"Typescript compiler\nPrepare test app:\nnpm init --yes\nnpm install --save-dev typescript@3.5.1\nnpm install --save-dev tsc-watch@2.1.2\n\nYou'll need also a typescript config file:\ntsconfig.js\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2018\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\"\n  }\n}\n\nAdd hello world application:\nsrc/index.ts\nfunction printMessage(msg: string): void {\n  console.log(`Message: ${msg}`);\n}\nprintMessage(\"Hello, TypeScript\");\n\nRemember to add script to your package.json:\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"tsc-watch --onSuccess \\\"node ./dist/index.js\\\"\"\n  },\n\nNPM version control\n\n\n\nFormat\ndesc\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1\nExact version\n\n\n*\nAny version\n\n\n>3.5.1 >=3.5.1\nGreater or greater and equal\n\n\n\nLess or less and equal\n\n\n~3.5.1\n3.5.2, 3.5.3 etc.\n\n\n^3.5.1\n3.5.2, 3.6.3 etc.\n\n\n\nCommands:\n\n\n\nCommand\ndesc\n\n\n\n\nnpm install\ninstall packags from package.json\n\n\nnpm install package@version\ninstall specific version, save it in dependencies\n\n\nnpm install --save-dev package@version\ninstall specific version, save it in devDependencies\n\n\nnpm list\nlist packages\n\n\nnpm run\nrun script\n\n\nnpx package\nrun specific package\n\n\n\nTypeScript config file\ntsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2018\",\n    \"outDir\": \"./dist\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"./src\"\n  }\n}\n\nTop level configuration settings:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncompilerOptions\nThis section groups the settings that the compiler will use\n\n\nfiles\nThis setting specifies the files that will be compiled, which overrides the default behavior where the compiler searches for files to compile.\n\n\ninclude\nThis setting is used to select files for compilation by pattern.

Leave formatting decisions to the individuals and rely on code editor reformatting when you need to read code written by a team member who has different preferences.\nLinting is not so important as you may think!\nUnit testing\nPreferred framework for testing TypeScript applications is Jest.\nnpm install --save-dev jest @types/jest ts-jest\n\nImportant: focus on writing unit tests for features and functions that you'll know will be hard to write and that are likely to be the source of bugs in deployment. In these situations, unit testing helps\nstructure thoughts about how to best implement what you need.\nConfiguring Jest\njest.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  roots: [\"src\"],\n  transform: { \"^.+\\\\.tsx?$\": \"ts-jest\" },\n};\n\nroots — sources.\ntransform — extensions & package for transformation.\nCreating unit tests\nSimply create a test file for your module using .test.ts naming convention src/opinions.ts → src/opinions.test.ts.\nWith example test:\nimport { iLike } from \"./opinions\";\n\ntest(\"check result\", () => {\n  const result = iLike(\"Ninja\");\n  expect(result).toBe(\"I like Ninja!\");\n});\n\nUseful matcher functions:\n\n\n\nName\nAssertion\n\n\n\n\ntoBe(value)\nSame value (same object)\n\n\ntoEqual(object)\nSame object\n\n\ntoMatch(regexp)\nTo match regular expression\n\n\ntoBeDefined()\nResult is defined\n\n\ntoBeUndefined()\n\n\n\ntoBeNull()\n\n\n\ntoBeTruthy()\nResult is truthy\n\n\ntoBeFalsy()\nResult is falsy\n\n\ntoContain(substring)\n\n\n\ntoBeLessThan(value)\n\n\n\ntoBeGreaterThan(value)\n\n\n\nRunning tests\nWatch method is most useful.

In fact, you're telling compiler that returned value us specific type.\nlet taxNumber = calculateTax(100, false) as number;\nlet taxString = calculateTax(100, true) as string;\nconsole.log(`Number Value: ${taxNumber.toFixed(2)}`);\nconsole.log(`String Value: ${taxString.charAt(0)}`);\n\nAttention! No conversion is used when asserting a type.\nAsserted types can be selected from returned union.\nIf you want to assert forcibly you can use this trick:\nlet taxBoolean = calculateTax(100, false) as any as boolean;\n\nAlternative assertion syntax\nlet taxString = calculateTax(100, true);\n\nWarning! This cannot be used in tsx files.\nUsing a type guard\nFor testing JS` primitive values:\nif (typeof taxValue === \"number\") {\n  console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n}\n\nCompiler will determine that taxValue is in fact a Number! It will trust if statement. It also follows switch syntax.\nswitch (typeof taxValue) {\n  case \"number\":\n    console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n    break;\n  case \"string\":\n    console.log(`String Value: ${taxValue.charAt(0)}`);\n    break;\n}\n\nUnderstating the never type\nswitch (typeof taxValue) {\n  case \"number\":\n    console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n    break;\n  case \"string\":\n    console.log(`String Value: ${taxValue.charAt(0)}`);\n    break;\n  default:\n    let value: never = taxValue;\n    console.log(`Unexpected type for value: ${value}`);\n}\n\nSomething has gone wrong if execution reaches the default clause of the switch statement, and TypeScript provides the never type to ensure you can’t accidentally use a value once type guards have been used to exhaustively narrow a value to all of its possible types.\nUsing unknown type\nunknown is a safer alternative to any. Only any and unknown can be assigned to such variable (unless type guard is used).\nsrc/index.ts(18,5): error TS2322: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'number'.\nNullable types\nThere is a hole in the TypeScript static type system: the JavaScript null and undefined types. The null type can be assigned only the null value and is used to represent something that doesn’t exist or is invalid. The undefined type can be assigned only the undefined value and is used when a variable has been defined but not yet assigned a value.\n\nThe problem is that, by default, TypeScript treats null and undefined as legal values for all types.\n\nAttention! In addition to type inconsistencies, nullable values can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to detect during development and often encountered by users.\nHow to disable nullable assignments?\nSimply add strictNullChecks to your tsconfig:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  }\n}\n\nWith this setting null and undefined cannot be assigned to other type of values.\nsrc/index.ts(3,9): error TS2322: Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.\nYou can always expand union with null:\nfunction calculateTax(amount: number, format: boolean): string | number | null {\n  if (amount === 0) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  const calcAmount = amount * 1.2;\n  return format ? `$${calcAmount.toFixed(2)}` : calcAmount;\n}\n\nlet taxValue: string | number | null = calculateTax(0, false);\n\n// More advanced type guard\nswitch (typeof taxValue) {\n  case \"number\":\n    console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n    break;\n  case \"string\":\n    console.log(`String Value: ${taxValue.charAt(0)}`);\n    break;\n  default:\n    if (taxValue === null) {\n      console.log(\"Value is null\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(typeof taxValue);\n      let value: never = taxValue;\n      console.log(`Unexpected type for value: ${value}`);\n    }\n}\n\nWarning! Using typeof on null values returns object.\nRemoving null from a union with assertion\nWarning! A non-null assertion should be used only when you know that a null value cannot occur. A runtime error will be caused if you apply the assertion and a null value does occur. A safer approach is to use a type guard, as described in the next section.\nlet taxValue: string | number = calculateTax(100, false)!;\n\nswitch (typeof taxValue) {\n  case \"number\":\n    console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n    break;\n  case \"string\":\n    console.log(`String Value: ${taxValue.charAt(0)}`);\n    break;\n  default:\n    if (taxValue === null) {\n      console.log(\"Value is null\");\n    } else {\n      console.log(typeof taxValue);\n      let value: never = taxValue;\n      console.log(`Unexpected type for value: ${value}`);\n    }\n}\n\nTo assert non-null you need to add exclamation mark on the end of expression.\nlet taxValue: string | number = calculateTax(100, false)!;\n\nRemoving null from a Union with a Type Guard\nAn alternative approach is to filter out null or undefined values using a type guard.\nlet taxValue: string | number | null = calculateTax(100, false);\nif (taxValue !== null) {\n  let nonNullTaxValue: string | number = taxValue;\n  switch (typeof taxValue) {\n    case \"number\":\n      console.log(`Number Value: ${taxValue.toFixed(2)}`);\n      break;\n    case \"string\":\n      console.log(`String Value: ${taxValue.charAt(0)}`);\n      break;\n  }\n} else {\n  console.log(\"Value is not a string or a number\");\n}\n\nUsing definite assignment assertion\nSometimes variable can be assigned the way it is invisible to a compiler. \nFor example:\nlet taxValue: string | number | null;\neval(\"taxValue = calculateTax(100, false)\");\n\nCompiler will not know that evaled variable was assigned!\nThe definitive assignment assertion tells TypeScript that a value will be assigned before the variable is used (no matter what).\nlet taxValue!: string | number | null;\n\nAttention! It's your role to keep this kind of assertion safe.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/007-using-functions.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/007-using-functions.html","title":"007 Using Functions","keywords":"","body":"Using functions\nExample compiler options for Node:\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es2018\",\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"rootDir\": \"src\",\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true,\n    \"noImplicitAny\": true,\n    \"declaration\": true,\n    \"noImplicitReturns\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true\n  }\n}\n\nAttention: many languages allow overloading functions if number of parameters is different.

It's important to use type guards in such situations.\nFunction result\nCompile will try to determine returned type automatic. If you want to see what's been determined, use declaration setting and check d.ts files in dist.\nIf you want to disable implicit returns use noImplictReturns. This way compile will try to catch situations where normally JS function would try to return undefined.\nNow to return undefined you'll need to:\nfunction calculateTax(\n  amount: number | null,\n  discount: number = 0,\n  ...extraFees: number[]\n) {\n  if (amount != null) {\n    return (\n      amount * 1.2 - discount + extraFees.reduce((total, val) => total + val, 0)\n    );\n  } else {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n}\n\nType annotations in function results\nIt's easy like:\nfunction calculateTax(\n  amount: number,\n  discount: number = 0,\n  ...extraFees: number[]\n): number {\n  return (\n    amount * 1.2 - discount + extraFees.reduce((total, val) => total + val, 0)\n  );\n}\n\nVoid functions\nfunction writeValue(label: string, value: number): void {\n  console.log(`${label}: ${value}`);\n}\n\nAttention! The never type can be used as the result type for functions that will never complete, such as functions that will always throw an exception or infinite loop.\nOverloading function types\nType unions make it possible to define a range of types for function parameters and results, but they don’t allow the relationship between them to be expressed accurately:\nfunction calculateTax(amount: number | null): number | null {\n  if (amount != null) {\n    return amount * 1.2;\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\nThis function will always return number if parameters is a number and null if a parameter is a null. There is no relation between parameter type and returned value.\nBut there is a way:\nfunction calculateTax(amount: number): number;\nfunction calculateTax(amount: null): null;\nfunction calculateTax(amount: number | null): number | null {\n  if (amount != null) {\n    return amount * 1.2;\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\nAttention! This is not real type overloading, it's used only for type checking during compilation.\nThere is no need for type guard if you're using type overloading.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/008-data-types.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/008-data-types.html","title":"008 Data Types","keywords":"","body":"Data types\nUsage of more complex data types.\nArrays\nTypeScript doesn’t change the flexible sizing of arrays, but it does allow the data types they contain to be restricted through the use of type annotations.\nlet prices: number[] = [100, 75, 42];\nlet names: string[] = [\"Hat\", \"Gloves\", \"Umbrella\"];\n\nprices.forEach((price: number, index: number) => {\n  writePrice(names[index], calculateTax(price));\n});\n\nAttention! forEach callback is also typed.

Simply check generated declaration files to see what's inferred.\nExample output of a declaration file:\nexport declare const mixed: (string | number)[];\nexport declare const inferred: (string | number)[];\n\nAvoiding problems with inferred array types\nThe compiler infers array types using the values used to populate the array when it is created.

Avoid using inferred array types, always use explicit typing.\nEmpty arrays are problems\nAnother reason for using type annotations for arrays is that the compiler will infer the type any for arrays that are created empty.\nIf you don't use noImplicitAny empty array without typing will be inferred as any.\nlet prices = [];\nprices.push(...[100, 75, 42, \"20\"]);\n\nAttention!

You can tweak that:\nenum Product {\n  Hat,\n  Gloves = 20,\n  Umbrella,\n}\n\nMeans:\ndeclare enum Product {\n  Hat = 0,\n  Gloves = 20,\n  Umbrella = 21,\n}\n\nWarning! Compile can duplicate values and overwrite them this way.\nYou can also evaluate Enum values:\nenum OtherEnum {\n  First = 10,\n  Two = 20,\n}\nenum Product {\n  Hat = OtherEnum.First + 1,\n  Gloves = 20,\n  Umbrella = Hat + Gloves,\n}\n\nAttention! These features can be useful, but close attention is required to avoid accidentally creating duplicate values or unexpected results. Keep Enums simple and leave the compiler to generate numbers wherever possible.\nUsing string Enums\nAn Enum can contain both string and number values, although this is not a feature that is widely used.\nenum City {\n  London = \"London\",\n  Paris = \"Paris\",\n  NY = \"New York\",\n}\nconsole.log(`City: ${City.London}`);\n\nBe careful with Enums\nlet productValue: Product = 0;\n\nThis won't be an error, event if there is no Product with 0 key.\nAlso, you won't be able to type guard an Enum:\nlet productValue: Product = Product.Hat;\nif (typeof productValue === \"number\") {\n  console.log(\"Value is a number\");\n}\nlet unionValue: number | Product = Product.Hat;\nif (typeof unionValue === \"number\") {\n  console.log(\"Value is a number\");\n}\n\nConstant Enums\nAttention! This is an advanced feature that is rarely required in most projects. Performance is faster in constant Enums.\nSimply add const keyword:\nconst enum Product {\n  Hat,\n  Gloves,\n  Umbrella,\n}\nlet productValue = Product.Hat;\n\nYou won't be able to use this code:\nconst enum Product {\n  Hat,\n  Gloves,\n  Umbrella,\n}\nlet productValue = Product.Hat;\nlet productName = Product[0];\n\nWill give:\nA const enum member can only be accessed using a string literal.\nUsing literal value types\nA literal value type specifies a specific set of values and allows only those values. The effect is to treat a set of values as a distinct type, which is a useful feature but can be difficult to understand because it blurs the separation between types and values.\nlet restrictedValue: 1 | 2 | 3 = 3;\nconsole.log(`Value: ${restrictedValue}`);\n\nLiteral values can overlap, but they need to include same value:\nlet restrictedValue: 1 | 2 | 3 = 1;\nlet secondValue: 1 | 10 | 100 = 1;\n\nrestrictedValue = secondValue; // OK!\nsecondValue = 100;\nrestrictedValue = secondValue; // Not OK!\n\nUsing literals in functions\nWell, they are most useful here:\nfunction calculatePrice(quantity: 1 | 2, price: number): number {\n  return quantity * price;\n}\n\nMixing types in literals\nYou can mix anything using this notation:\nfunction getRandomValue(): 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 {\n  return (Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1) as 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;\n}\nenum City {\n  London = \"LON\",\n  Paris = \"PAR\",\n  Chicago = \"CHI\",\n}\nfunction getMixedValue(): 1 | \"Hello\" | true | City.London {\n  switch (getRandomValue()) {\n    case 1:\n      return 1;\n    case 2:\n      return \"Hello\";\n    case 3:\n      return true;\n    case 4:\n      return City.London;\n  }\n}\n\nYou can mix types with specific values in literals!\nCheck this out:\nlet foo: string | true | 3 = 3;\n\nOverrides with literals\nType overrides can also be applied to literal value types, which are essentially unions for individual values.\nfunction getMixedValue(input: 1): 1;\nfunction getMixedValue(input: 2 | 3): \"Hello\" | true;\nfunction getMixedValue(input: 4): City.London;\nfunction getMixedValue(input: number): 1 | \"Hello\" | true | City.London {\n  switch (input) {\n    case 1:\n      return 1;\n    case 2:\n      return \"Hello\";\n    case 3:\n      return true;\n    case 4:\n    default:\n      return City.London;\n  }\n}\n\nUsing type aliases\nYou can name a type combined of multiple ones:\ntype comboType = [string, number | true, 1 | 2 | 3 | City.London][];\nfunction getValue(input: comboType): comboType {\n  return [\n    [\"Apples\", 100, 2],\n    [\"Oranges\", true, 3],\n  ];\n}\nlet result: comboType = getValue([[\"Bananas\", true, 1]]);\n\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/009-working-with-objects.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/009-working-with-objects.html","title":"009 Working With Objects","keywords":"","body":"Working with objects\nTypeScript focuses on an object’s “shape,” which is the combination of its property names and types.\nThese are object shapes:\ndeclare let hat: { name: string; price: number };\ndeclare let gloves: { name: string; price: number };\ndeclare let umbrella: { name: string };\ndeclare let products: { name: string }[];\n\n(generated through declaration: true setting in tsconfig).\nUsing object shape type annotations\nFor object literals TS is creating automatic type of each property using its value.

I will be undefined in unsupported types.\nIncluding methods in shape types\nenum Feature {\n  Waterproof,\n  Insulated,\n}\n\nlet hat = { name: \"Hat\", price: 100 };\nlet gloves = { name: \"Gloves\", price: 75 };\nlet umbrella = {\n  name: \"Umbrella\",\n  price: 30,\n  hasFeature: (feature) => feature === Feature.Waterproof,\n};\n\nlet products: {\n  name: string;\n  price?: number;\n  hasFeature?(Feature): boolean;\n}[] = [hat, gloves, umbrella];\n\nproducts.forEach((prod) =>\n  console.log(\n    `${prod.name}: ${prod.price} ` +\n      `Waterproof: ${prod.hasFeature(Feature.Waterproof)}`\n  )\n);\n\nThis will cause error, because method need to be provided in a such case:\nenum God {\n  Satan,\n  Jahwe,\n}\n\nlet believer = { name: \"Jan\", believesGod: (god: number) => god === God.Satan };\nlet believer2 = {\n  name: \"Michal\",\n  believesGod: (god: number) => god === God.Jahwe,\n};\n\nlet believers: { name: string; believesGod(god: number): boolean }[] = [\n  believer,\n  believer2,\n];\n\nbelievers.forEach((believer) =>\n  console.log(\n    `${believer.name} believes god ${believer.believesGod(God.Jahwe)}`\n  )\n);\n\nNotice: strictNullChecks may protect you from such errors.\nBut if you want force it and check if optional method exists, you can use this code:\nproducts.forEach((prod) =>\n  console.log(\n    `${prod.name}: ${prod.price} ` +\n      `${prod.hasFeature ? prod.hasFeature(Feature.Waterproof) : \"false\"}`\n  )\n);\n\nType aliases for shape types\nA type alias can be used to give a name to a specific shape, making it easier to refer to the shape in code\nconsistently.\nenum Feature {\n  Waterproof,\n  Insulated,\n}\n\ntype Product = {\n  name: string;\n  price?: number;\n  hasFeature?(Feature): boolean;\n};\n\nlet hat = { name: \"Hat\", price: 100 };\nlet gloves = { name: \"Gloves\", price: 75 };\nlet umbrella = {\n  name: \"Umbrella\",\n  price: 30,\n  hasFeature: (feature) => feature === Feature.Waterproof,\n};\nlet products: Product[] = [hat, gloves, umbrella];\n\nDealing with excess properties\nThere are times when it's better to provide compiler with more information because it might change its behavior.\nenum Feature {\n  Waterproof,\n  Insulated,\n}\ntype Product = {\n  name: string;\n  price?: number;\n  hasFeature?(Feature): boolean;\n};\n\nlet hat = { name: \"Hat\", price: 100 };\nlet gloves = { name: \"Gloves\", price: 75 };\nlet umbrella = {\n  name: \"Umbrella\",\n  price: 30,\n  hasFeature: (feature) => feature === Feature.Waterproof,\n};\nlet mirrorShades = { name: \"Sunglasses\", price: 54, finish: \"mirrored\" };\nlet darkShades: Product = { name: \"Sunglasses\", price: 54, finish: \"flat\" };\nlet products: Product[] = [hat, gloves, umbrella, mirrorShades, darkShades];\n\nWill break with following error:\nsrc/index.ts(16,60): error TS2322: Type '{ name: string; price: number; finish: string; }' is not assignable to type 'Product'\nObject literal may only specify known properties, and 'finish' does not exist in type 'Product'.\n\nCompiler treats mirrorShades and darkShades differently because second one is using Product type.\nYou can disable this behavior by using suppressExcessPropertyErrors option in the tsconfig file.\nUsing shape type unions\nType unions are types in their own right and contain the properties that are defined by all of their constituent types. This isn’t a useful feature when dealing with unions of primitive data types because there are few common properties.\ntype Product = {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  price?: number;\n};\n\ntype Person = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  city: string;\n};\n\nlet hat = { id: 1, name: \"Hat\", price: 100 };\nlet gloves = { id: 2, name: \"Gloves\", price: 75 };\nlet umbrella = { id: 3, name: \"Umbrella\", price: 30 };\nlet bob = { id: \"bsmith\", name: \"Bob\", city: \"London\" };\nlet dataItems: (Product | Person)[] = [hat, gloves, umbrella, bob];\n\nAttention: type union is a cross between two types. Only properties shared by them can be used. In fact type union is a new type with shared properties only.\nUnion property types\nThis shows effect of a union of two types:\ntype Product = {\n  id: number;\n  name: string;\n  price?: number;\n};\n\ntype Person = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  city: string;\n};\n\ntype UnionType = {\n  id: number | string;\n  name: string;\n};\n\nlet dataItems: UnionType[] = [hat, gloves, umbrella, bob];\n\nThe conclusion is that union types must be compatible.\nUsing type guards for objects\nType guards are still required to get to a specific type to access all the features it defines.\ntypeof will return object for all objects, so we need to check if specific properties exist.\ndataItems.forEach((item) => {\n  if (\"city\" in item) {\n    console.log(`Person: ${item.name}: ${item.city}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Product: ${item.name}: ${item.price}`);\n  }\n});\n\nAttention: the in operator returns true if the specified property is in the specified object or its prototype chain. It is a part of standard JS language.\nAvoiding common type guard problems\nIt is important to create accurate type guard tests. There two common problems ahead:\n\nInaccurate tests:\n\n// Both types have id and name\nif (\"id\" in item && \"name\" in item) {\n  console.log(`Person: ${item.name}: ${item.city}`);\n} else {\n  console.log(`Product: ${item.name}: ${item.price}`);\n}\n\n\nTesting for optional property:\n\nif (\"price\" in item) {\n  console.log(`Product: ${item.name}: ${item.price}`);\n} else {\n  console.log(`Person: ${item.name}: ${item.city}`);\n}\n\nprice is optional, so type might be mistaken.\nType guarding with a type predicate function\nThe in keyword is a useful way to identify whether an object conforms to a shape, but it requires the same checks to be written each time types need to be identified. TypeScript also supports guarding object types using a function.\nfunction isPerson(testObj: any): testObj is Person {\n  return testObj.city !== undefined;\n}\ndataItems.forEach((item) => {\n  if (isPerson(item)) {\n    console.log(`Person: ${item.name}: ${item.city}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Product: ${item.name}: ${item.price}`);\n  }\n});\n\nAs you for this purpose is keyword was used.\n\nIf the result of the function is true, then the TypeScript compiler will treat the object as the specified type.\n\nUsing a function for type guarding can be more flexible because the parameter type is any, allowing properties to be tested for without having to use string literals and the in keyword.\nImportant! You should prefix your type checking functions using is.\nThis way you can create helper methods for advanced type checking.\nType intersections\nWarning! Type intersections combine features of multiple types, not like in unions case, where you can use only common things.\ntype Person = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  city: string;\n};\n\ntype Employee = {\n  company: string;\n  dept: string;\n};\n\nlet bob = {\n  id: \"bsmith\",\n  name: \"Bob\",\n  city: \"London\",\n  company: \"Acme Co\",\n  dept: \"Sales\",\n};\n\nlet dataItems: (Person & Employee)[] = [bob];\n\nIn simple words intersection is a combination of two types.\nUsing intersections for data correlation\nIntersections are useful when you receive objects from one source and need to introduce new functionality, so they can be used elsewhere in the application or when objects from two data sources need to be correlated and combined.\ntype Person = {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  city: string;\n};\ntype Employee = {\n  id: string;\n  company: string;\n  dept: string;\n};\ntype EmployedPerson = Person & Employee;\n\nfunction correlateData(\n  peopleData: Person[],\n  staff: Employee[]\n): EmployedPerson[] {\n  const defaults = { company: \"None\", dept: \"None\" };\n  return peopleData.map((p) => ({\n    ...p,\n    ...(staff.find((e) => e.id === p.id) || { ...defaults, id: p.id }),\n  }));\n}\n\nlet dataItems: EmployedPerson[] = correlateData(people, employees);\n\nAs you can see you can merge both types ant corresponding objects into one.\nUnderstanding intersection merging\nTypeScript` types fit objects when they have all needed properties. Excess properties will be ignored.\nfunction writePerson(per: Person): void {\n  console.log(`Person: ${per.id}, ${per.name}, ${per.city}`);\n}\nfunction writeEmployee(emp: Employee): void {\n  console.log(`Employee: ${emp.id}, ${emp.company}, ${emp.dept}`);\n}\ndataItems.forEach((item) => {\n  writePerson(item);\n  writeEmployee(item);\n});\n\nSo types can be interchanged.\n\nImportant! It may seem obvious that an intersection type is compatible with each of its constituents, but it has an important effect when the types in the intersection define properties with the same name: the type of the property in the intersection is an intersection of the individual property types.\n\nMerging properties with the same type\nThe simplest example is when two types have the same property, with the same type.\ntype Person = {\n  id: string;\n};\n\ntype Employee = {\n  id: string;\n};\n\ntype Merged = Person & Employee;\n\nType Merged will simply have id property with type string.\nMerging properties with different types\nIf there are properties with the same name and different types, compile will intersect them.\ntype Person = {\n  id: number;\n};\n\ntype Employee = {\n  id: string;\n};\n\ntype Merged = Person & Employee;\n\n\nIf you have enabled declarations option in tsconfig, you can use this cool trick to check type of property:\n\nlet typeTest = ({} as EmployedPerson).contact;\n// declare let typeTest: number & string;\n\nWarning! Type number & string is impossible type. There's no such var to pass into this type. In this case you'll need to adjust your objects shapes.\nSolution!\nUse shape types:\ntype Person = {\n  contact: { phone: number };\n};\n\ntype Employee = {\n  contact: { name: string };\n};\n\ntype Merged = Person & Employee;\n\nlet typeTest = ({} as EmployedPerson).contact;\n// contact: { phone: number } & { name: string }\n\nlet person1: EmployedPerson = {\n  id: \"bsmith\",\n  name: \"Bob Smith\",\n  city: \"London\",\n  company: \"Acme Co\",\n  dept: \"Sales\",\n  contact: { name: \"Alice\", phone: 6512346543 },\n};\n\nMerging methods\ntype Person = {\n  getContact(field: string): string;\n};\ntype Employee = {\n  getContact(field: number): number;\n};\n\n// getContact: (field: string) => string & (field: number) => number\n\nThis will create impossible type of two function signatures.\nWarning! Typescript compiler does not care about impossible types. You mas take these precautions.\nOnce again you can use declarations option to debug this:\nlet typeTest = person.getContact;\nlet stringParamTypeTest = person.getContact(\"Alice\");\nlet numberParamTypeTest = person.getContact(123);\n\nAttention! You should not use any but sometimes is unavoidable. You should write this method following way:\ngetContact(field: string | number): any {\n  return typeof field === \"string\" ? \"Alice\" : 6512346543;\n}\n\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/010-working-with-classes.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/010-working-with-classes.html","title":"010 Working With Classes","keywords":"","body":"Working with classes\nWhen working with TypeScript you should use class notation.

Using insteanceof you can guard your set from using non-existent methods.\n\nA ∪ B — means union (you can read it as OR).\nA ∩ B — means intersection (which has only common elements, you can read it as AND).\n\nUsing access control keywords\nThanks to TypeScript JS supports access keywords similar to other languages.\npublic — default, allowed access.\nprivate — This keyword restricts access to the class that defines the property or method it is applied to.\nprotected — This keyword restricts access to the class that defines the property or method it is applied to and its subclasses.\nNotice: public is default access of a properties and methods, but you should add it for better readability.\nclass Employee {\n  public id: string;\n  public name: string;\n  private dept: string;\n  public city: string;\n  constructor(id: string, name: string, dept: string, city: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n    this.name = name;\n    this.dept = dept;\n    this.city = city;\n  }\n  writeDept() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} works in ${this.dept}`);\n  }\n}\n\nAttention! Access keywords are purely virtual. In JavaScript runtime everything will be available to environment.\n\nIf you want to protect your variables from not being initialized, use strictPropertyInitialization option in tsconfig.json.\n\nRead-only properties\nreadonly allows you to protect properties. They can to be initialized only in constructor.\nclass Employee {\n  public readonly id: string;\n  constructor(id: string, name: string, dept: string, city: string) {\n    this.id = id;\n  }\n}\n\nlet salesEmployee = new Employee(\"fvega\", \"Fidel Vega\", \"Sales\", \"Paris\");\nsalesEmployee.writeDept();\nsalesEmployee.id = \"fidel\"; // src/index.ts(27,15): error TS2540: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.\n\nAttention! This feature is also synthetic and also enforced only by TypeScript.\nSimplifying class constructors\nTypeScript can populate class properties automatically:\nclass Employee {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    private dept: string,\n    public city: string\n  ) {\n    // no statements required\n  }\n  writeDept() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} works in ${this.dept}`);\n  }\n}\n\nThe compiler automatically creates an instance property for each of the constructor arguments to which an access control keyword has been applied and assigns the parameter value. The use of the access control keywords doesn’t change the way the constructor is invoked and is required only to tell the compiler that corresponding instance variables are required.\nClass inheritance\nTypeScript builds on the standard class inheritance features to make them more consistent and familiar,\nwith some useful additions for commonly required tasks and for restricting some JavaScript characteristics that can cause problems.\nclass Person {\n  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public city: string) {}\n}\n\nclass Employee extends Person {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    private dept: string,\n    public city: string\n  ) {\n    super(id, name, city);\n  }\n\n  writeDept() {\n    console.log(`${this.name} works in ${this.dept}`);\n  }\n}\nlet data = [\n  new Person(\"bsmith\", \"Bob Smith\", \"London\"),\n  new Employee(\"fvega\", \"Fidel Vega\", \"Sales\", \"Paris\"),\n];\ndata.forEach((item) => {\n  console.log(`Person: ${item.name}, ${item.city}`);\n  if (item instanceof Employee) {\n    item.writeDept();\n  }\n});\n\nNotice: When using extends keyword you must pass properties to higher order class using super keyword.\nUnderstanding type inference for subclasses\nCaution is required when letting the compiler infer types from classes because it is easy to produce unexpected results by assuming the compiler has insight into the hierarchy of classes.\nTo avoid this kind of error you should annotate type of your data:\nclass Customer extends Person {}\nclass Supplier extends Person {}\n\nlet data: Person[] = [\n  new Employee(\"fvega\", \"Fidel Vega\", \"Sales\", \"Paris\"),\n  new Customer(\"ajones\", \"Alice Jones\", \"London\", 500),\n];\n\ndata.push(new Supplier(\"dpeters\", \"Dora Peters\", \"New York\", \"Acme\"));\n\nAbstract classes\nAbstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They can be used as skeletons for other classes.\nabstract class Person {\n  constructor(public id: string, public name: string, public city: string) {}\n  getDetails(): string {\n    return `${this.name}, ${this.getSpecificDetails()}`;\n  }\n  abstract getSpecificDetails(): string;\n}\n\nclass Employee extends Person {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    private dept: string,\n    public city: string\n  ) {\n    super(id, name, city);\n  }\n  getSpecificDetails() {\n    return `works in ${this.dept}`;\n  }\n}\n\nAttention! The abstract keyword is also applied to individual methods, which are defined without a body, as shown in Figure.\nType guarding abstract classes\nAbstract classes are purely TypeScript construct. They can be instantiated in JS by mistake.\ndata.forEach((item) => {\n  if (item instanceof Person) {\n    console.log(item.getDetails());\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Customer: ${item.name}`);\n  }\n});\n\nUsing interfaces\nInterfaces are used to shape an object. Class of such object must conform to used interface.\n\nNote: Interfaces are similar to shape types. There are no big differences between them. However, they provide experience that is similar to other programming languages. So you should use them to define class shapes.\n\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  getDetails(): string;\n}\n\nclass Employee implements Person {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    private dept: string,\n    public city: string\n  ) {\n    // no statements required\n  }\n  getDetails() {\n    return `${this.name} works in ${this.dept}`;\n  }\n}\n\nlet data: Person[] = [\n  new Employee(\"fvega\", \"Fidel Vega\", \"Sales\", \"Paris\"),\n  new Customer(\"ajones\", \"Alice Jones\", \"London\", 500),\n];\n\nUnlike abstract classes, interfaces don’t implement methods or define a constructor and just define a\nshape. Interfaces are implemented by classes through the implements keyword.\nThe data array can contain any object created from a class that implements the Product array, although\nthe function passed to the forEach method is able to access only the features defined by the interface unless objects are narrowed to a more specific type.\nNotice Interfaces can be merged together. The declarations must be made in the same code file, and they must all be exported (defined with the\nexport keyword) or defined locally (defined without the export keyword).\nImplementing multiple interfaces\nA class can implement more than one interface, meaning it must define the methods and properties defined by all of them.\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  getDetails(): string;\n}\ninterface DogOwner {\n  dogName: string;\n  getDogDetails(): string;\n}\nclass Customer implements Person, DogOwner {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    public city: string,\n    public creditLimit: number,\n    public dogName\n  ) {\n    // no statements required\n  }\n  getDetails() {\n    return `${this.name} has ${this.creditLimit} limit`;\n  }\n  getDogDetails() {\n    return `${this.name} has a dog named ${this.dogName}`;\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote: class can implement multiple interfaces only if there are no overlapping properties with conflicting\ntypes.\n\nExtending interfaces\nInterfaces can be extended similar to classes.\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  getDetails(): string;\n}\ninterface DogOwner extends Person {\n  dogName: string;\n  getDogDetails(): string;\n}\nclass Customer implements DogOwner {\n  // Both interfaces methods & properties\n}\n\n\nObjects created from the Customer class can be treated as both DogOwner and\nPerson objects, since they always define the shapes required by each interface.\n\nThe extend keyword is used to extend an interface. In the listing, the DogOwner interface extends the Person interface, which means that classes that implement DogOwner must define the properties and methods from both interfaces.\nShapes and interfaces\nAs noted at the start of this section, shape types and interfaces can often be used interchangeably. Classes can, for example, use the implements keyword with a shape type to indicate they implement the properties in the shape, like this:\ntype Person = {\n  name: string;\n  getDetails(): string;\n};\n\nclass Employee implements Person {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    private dept: string,\n    public city: string\n  ) {\n    // no statements required\n  }\n  getDetails() {\n    return `${this.name} works in ${this.dept}`;\n  }\n}\n\nAlso interface can extend type:\ntype NamedObject = {\n  name: string;\n};\ninterface Person extends NamedObject {\n  getDetails(): string;\n}\n\nConclusion: type shapes and interfaces can be mixed together in various ways.\nOptional interface properties and methods\ninterface Person {\n  name: string;\n  getDetails(): string;\n  dogName?: string;\n  getDogDetails?(): string;\n}\nclass Customer implements Person {}\n\nlet data: Person[] = [\n  new Employee(\"fvega\", \"Fidel Vega\", \"Sales\", \"Paris\"),\n  alice,\n];\n\ndata.forEach((item) => {\n  console.log(item.getDetails());\n  if (item.getDogDetails) {\n    console.log(item.getDogDetails());\n  }\n});\n\n\nYou must check for optional interfaces in JS.\n\nDefining abstract interface implementation\nThis can reduce code duplication when some of the classes that implement an interface would do so, in the same way, using the same code.\nabstract class AbstractDogOwner implements Person {\n  abstract name: string;\n  abstract dogName?: string;\n  abstract getDetails();\n  getDogDetails() {\n    if (this.dogName) {\n      return `${this.name} has a dog called ${this.dogName}`;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nclass DogOwningCustomer extends AbstractDogOwner {\n  constructor(\n    public readonly id: string,\n    public name: string,\n    public city: string,\n    public creditLimit: number,\n    public dogName\n  ) {\n    super();\n  }\n  getDetails() {\n    return `${this.name} has ${this.creditLimit} limit`;\n  }\n}\n\nType guarding an interface\n\nThere is no JavaScript equivalent to interfaces, and no details of interfaces are included in the JavaScript code generated by the TypeScript compiler. Type guarding can be done only by checking for one or more properties that are defined by the interface.\n\nlet data: (Person | Product)[] = [\n  new Employee(\"Bob Smith\", \"Acme\"),\n  new SportsProduct(\"Running Shoes\", \"Running\", 90.5),\n  new Employee(\"Dora Peters\", \"BigCo\"),\n];\n\ndata.forEach((item) => {\n  if (\"getDetails\" in item) {\n    console.log(`Person: ${item.getDetails()}`);\n  } else {\n    console.log(`Product: ${item.name}, ${item.price}`);\n  }\n});\n\nDynamically creating properties\nThe TypeScript compiler only allows values to be assigned to properties that are part of an object’s type, which means that interfaces and classes have to define all the properties that the application requires.\nclass ProductGroup {\n  constructor(...initialProducts: [string, Product][]) {\n    initialProducts.forEach((p) => (this[p[0]] = p[1]));\n  }\n  [propertyName: string]: Product;\n}\n\nlet group = new ProductGroup([\n  \"shoes\",\n  new SportsProduct(\"Shoes\", \"Running\", 90.5),\n]);\n\ngroup.hat = new SportsProduct(\"Hat\", \"Skiing\", 20);\nObject.keys(group).forEach((k) => console.log(`Property Name: ${k}`));\n\nProductGroup receives tuples [string, Product] through its constructor. Each of which is used to create a new property. \nClasses can define index signature to prevent noImplictAny errors, it looks like this:\n[propertyName: string]: Product;\n\nAn index signature uses square brackets to\nspecify the type of the property keys, followed by a type annotation that restricts the types that can be used to create dynamic properties.

You'll need some kind of type narrowing.\nclass DataCollection {\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n\n  // This will give you error\n  getNames(): string[] {\n    return this.items.map((item) => item.name);\n  }\n}\n\nYou can do type narrowing:\nclass DataCollection {\n  private items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  add(newItem: T) {\n    this.items.push(newItem);\n  }\n  getNames(): string[] {\n    return this.items.map((item) => item.name);\n  }\n}\n\nThis will allow you using specific properties from the types.\n\nThe first restriction constrains the types that can be used as the generic type argument to create a new DataCollection object so that only types that can be assigned to Product | Person can be used as the type parameter value.\n\nConstraining generic types using shapes\nYou can use simple inline shape like this one:\nclass DataCollection {\n  private items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  getNames(): string[] {\n    return this.items.map((item) => item.name);\n  }\n}\n\nThe shape specified in Listing 12-10 tells the compiler that the DataCollection class can be instantiated using any type that has a name property that returns a string.\nMultiple type parameters\nclass DataCollection {\n  private items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  collate(targetData: U[], itemProp: string, targetProp: string): (T & U)[] {\n    let results = [];\n    this.items.forEach((item) => {\n      let match = targetData.find((d) => d[targetProp] === item[itemProp]);\n      if (match !== undefined) {\n        results.push({ ...match, ...item });\n      }\n    });\n    return results;\n  }\n}\n\nlet peopleData = new DataCollection(people);\n\n\nThis can be used to create collation of two objects that are intersected by some property.\n\nApplying a type parameter to a method\ncollate(targetData: U[], itemProp: string, targetProp: string): (T & U)[] {\n  let results = [];\n  this.items.forEach(item => {\n    let match = targetData.find(d => d[targetProp] === item[itemProp]);\n    if (match !== undefined) {\n      results.push({ ...match, ...item });\n    }\n  });\n  return results;\n}\n\nType parameter is applied directly to the collate method, allowing a type to be provided when the method is invoked:\nlet collatedData = peopleData.collate(cities, \"city\", \"name\");\n\nLet the compiler infer type arguments\nexport let peopleData = new DataCollection(people);\nexport let collatedData = peopleData.collate(cities, \"city\", \"name\");\ncollatedData.forEach((c) =>\n  console.log(`${c.name}, ${c.city}, ${c.population}`)\n);\nexport let empData = peopleData.collate(employees, \"name\", \"name\");\nempData.forEach((c) => console.log(`${c.name}, ${c.city}, ${c.role}`));\n\nThe compiler is able to infer type arguments based on the argument passed to the DataCollection constructor. You can check inferred types by looking into index.d.ts file.\n\nAttention: In a project that uses modules, declaration files contain only exported values.\n\nTypes inferred by compile should look like these:\nexport declare let peopleData: DataCollection;\nexport declare let collatedData: (Person & City)[];\nexport declare let empData: (Person & Employee)[];\n\nAdding extra features to the existing type parameters\nFirst approach\nThe first approach is to simply add features to those defined by the superclass using the same generic types.\nclass DataCollection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  collate(targetData: U[], itemProp: string, targetProp: string): (T & U)[] {\n    let results = [];\n    this.items.forEach((item) => {\n      let match = targetData.find((d) => d[targetProp] === item[itemProp]);\n      if (match !== undefined) {\n        results.push({ ...match, ...item });\n      }\n    });\n    return results;\n  }\n}\n\nclass SearchableCollection extends DataCollection {\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    super(initialItems);\n  }\n  find(name: string): T | undefined {\n    return this.items.find((item) => item.name === name);\n  }\n}\n\nlet peopleData = new SearchableCollection(people);\nlet foundPerson = peopleData.find(\"Bob Smith\");\nif (foundPerson !== undefined) {\n  console.log(`Person ${foundPerson.name}, ${foundPerson.city}`);\n}\n\nFixing generic type parameter\nSome classes need to define functionality that is only available using a subset of the types that are supported by the superclass. In these situations, a subclass can use a fixed type for the superclass’s type parameter, such that the subclass is not a generic class.\nclass SearchableCollection extends DataCollection {\n  constructor(initialItems: Employee[]) {\n    super(initialItems);\n  }\n  find(searchTerm: string): Employee[] {\n    return this.items.filter(\n      (item) => item.name === searchTerm || item.role === searchTerm\n    );\n  }\n}\nlet employeeData = new SearchableCollection(employees);\nemployeeData\n  .find(\"Sales\")\n  .forEach((e) => console.log(`Employee ${e.name}, ${e.role}`));\n\nThe SearchableCollection class extends DataCollection, which fixes the generic type parameter so that the SearchableCollection can deal only with Employee objects.\nRestricting the Generic Type Parameter\nThe third approach strikes a balance between the previous two examples, providing a generic type variable but restricting it to specific types.\nclass SearchableCollection extends DataCollection {\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    super(initialItems);\n  }\n  find(searchTerm: string): T[] {\n    return this.items.filter((item) => {\n      if (item instanceof Employee) {\n        return item.name === searchTerm || item.role === searchTerm;\n      } else if (item instanceof Person) {\n        return item.name === searchTerm || item.city === searchTerm;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\nlet employeeData = new SearchableCollection(employees);\n\n\nBear in mind that when a union is used to constrain a generic type parameter, the union itself is an acceptable argument for that parameter. This means that the SearchableCollection class can be instantiated with a type parameter of Employee, Product, and Employee | Product.\nThis code uses instanceof operator.\n\nType guarding generic types\nFor classes with type parameters that are not restricted, narrowing to a specific type can be difficult.\nclass DataCollection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  filter(): V[] {\n    return this.items.filter((item) => item instanceof V) as V[];\n  }\n}\n\nlet mixedData = new DataCollection([...people, ...products]);\nlet filteredProducts = mixedData.filter();\nfilteredProducts.forEach((p) => console.log(`Product: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`));\n\n\nAttention! The filter method’s generic type parameter, named V, is defined with the extend keyword, telling the compiler that it can only accept types that can be assigned to the class generic type T, which prevents the compiler from treating V as any.\n\nAbove example will output error:\nerror TS2693: 'V' only refers to a type, but is being used as a value here.\n\ninstanceof operator does not know anything about generic types! That's why you'll get an error.\n\nIn such situations you'll need to use type predicate function:\nclass DataCollection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  filter(predicate: (target) => target is V): V[] {\n    return this.items.filter((item) => predicate(item)) as V[];\n  }\n}\n\nfunction isProduct(target): target is Product {\n  return target instanceof Product;\n}\nlet filteredProducts = mixedData.filter(isProduct);\nfilteredProducts.forEach((p) => console.log(`Product: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`));\n\nThe predicate function for the required type is provided as an argument to the filter method using JavaScript features that are available when the code is executed; this provides the method with the means to select the required objects.\nStatic methods in a generic classes\nStatic methods cannot use generic class type parameters.\nclass DataCollection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  filter(predicate: (target) => target is V): V[] {\n    return this.items.filter((item) => predicate(item)) as V[];\n  }\n  static reverse(items: any[]) {\n    return items.reverse();\n  }\n}\n\nlet reversedCities: City[] = DataCollection.reverse(cities);\n\nAs you can see, you must type a variable when using such methods.\nStatic methods can define their own generic type parameters:\nclass DataCollection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  constructor(initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items.push(...initialItems);\n  }\n  filter(predicate: (target) => target is V): V[] {\n    return this.items.filter((item) => predicate(item)) as V[];\n  }\n  static reverse(items: ArrayType[]): ArrayType[] {\n    return items.reverse();\n  }\n}\n\nlet reversedCities = DataCollection.reverse(cities);\n\nGeneric interfaces\nThis is quite simple:\ntype shapeType = { name: string };\ninterface Collection {\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void;\n  get(name: string): T;\n  count: number;\n}\n\nExtending generic type interfaces\nGeneric interfaces can be extended just like regular interfaces, and the options for dealing with its type parameters are the same as when extending a generic class.\ntype shapeType = { name: string };\n\ninterface Collection {\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void;\n  get(name: string): T;\n  count: number;\n}\ninterface SearchableCollection extends Collection {\n  find(name: string): T | undefined;\n}\ninterface ProductCollection extends Collection {\n  sumPrices(): number;\n}\ninterface PeopleCollection extends Collection {\n  getNames(): string[];\n}\n\nImplementing a Generic Interface\nWhen a class implements interface, it must implement all of its properties and methods. It has some choices over how to deal with type parameters.\nPassing on the generic type parameter\ntype shapeType = { name: string };\ninterface Collection {\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void;\n  get(name: string): T;\n  count: number;\n}\n\nclass ArrayCollection\n  implements Collection\n{\n  private items: DataType[] = [];\n  add(...newItems): void {\n    this.items.push(...newItems);\n  }\n  get(name: string): DataType {\n    return this.items.find((item) => item.name === name);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.length;\n  }\n}\nlet peopleCollection: Collection = new ArrayCollection();\n\npeopleCollection.add(\n  new Person(\"Bob Smith\", \"London\"),\n  new Person(\"Dora Peters\", \"New York\")\n);\n\nClass ArrayCollection conforms Collection interface.\nYou need to type such collection:\nlet peopleCollection: Collection = new ArrayCollection();\n\nRestricting / fixing generic type parameter\nclass PersonCollection implements Collection {\n  private items: Person[] = [];\n  add(...newItems: Person[]): void {\n    this.items.push(...newItems);\n  }\n  get(name: string): Person {\n    return this.items.find((item) => item.name === name);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.length;\n  }\n}\nlet peopleCollection: Collection = new PersonCollection();\n\nCreating abstract interface implementations\nThe abstract class has the same set of options for dealing with type parameters as regular classes: pass it on to subclasses unchanged, apply further restrictions, or fix for specific types.\nabstract class ArrayCollection implements Collection {\n  protected items: T[] = [];\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void {\n    this.items.push(...newItems);\n  }\n  abstract get(searchTerm: string): T;\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.length;\n  }\n}\nclass ProductCollection extends ArrayCollection {\n  get(searchTerm: string): Product {\n    return this.items.find((item) => item.name === name);\n  }\n}\nclass PersonCollection extends ArrayCollection {\n  get(searchTerm: string): Person {\n    return this.items.find((item) => item.name === name || item.city === name);\n  }\n}\n\nlet peopleCollection: Collection = new PersonCollection();\n\nThe ArrayCollection class is abstract and provides a partial implementation of the Collection interface, leaving subclasses to provide the get method. The ProductCollection and PersonCollection classes extend ArrayCollection, narrowing the generic type parameter to specific types and implementing the get method to use the properties of the type they operate on.\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/012-advanced-generic-types.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/012-advanced-generic-types.html","title":"012 Advanced Generic Types","keywords":"","body":"Advanced generic types\nGeneric collections\nIn TS you can use JavaScript collections with generic type parameters.\n\nMap — This describes a Map whose key type is K and whose value type is V.\nReadonlyMap — The same as above but read only.\nSet — This describes a Set whose value type is T.\nSet — The same as above but read only.\n\nclass Collection {\n  private items: Set;\n  constructor(initialItems: T[] = []) {\n    this.items = new Set(initialItems);\n  }\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void {\n    newItems.forEach((newItem) => this.items.add(newItem));\n  }\n  get(name: string): T {\n    return [...this.items.values()].find((item) => item.name === name);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.size;\n  }\n}\n\n\nAttention!

Iterators were introduced in the JavaScript ES6 standard. If you use iterators in your project and are targeting earlier versions of JavaScript, then you must set the TypeScript downlevelIteration compiler property to true.\n\nCombination of iterable and iterator\nYou can iterate objects more elegantly using this interface:\nclass Collection {\n  private items: Map;\n  constructor(initialItems: T[] = []) {\n    this.items = new Map();\n    this.add(...initialItems);\n  }\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void {\n    newItems.forEach((newItem) => this.items.set(newItem.name, newItem));\n  }\n  get(name: string): T {\n    return this.items.get(name);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.size;\n  }\n  values(): IterableIterator {\n    return this.items.values();\n  }\n}\nlet productCollection: Collection = new Collection(products);\nconsole.log(`There are ${productCollection.count} products`);\n[...productCollection.values()].forEach((p) =>\n  console.log(`Product: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`)\n);\n\nCreating an iterable class\nClasses that define a Symbol.iterator property can implement the Iterable interface, which allows iteration without needing to call a method or read a property:\nclass Collection implements Iterable {\n  private items: Map;\n  constructor(initialItems: T[] = []) {\n    this.items = new Map();\n    this.add(...initialItems);\n  }\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void {\n    newItems.forEach((newItem) => this.items.set(newItem.name, newItem));\n  }\n  get(name: string): T {\n    return this.items.get(name);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.size;\n  }\n  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator {\n    return this.items.values();\n  }\n}\n\nlet productCollection: Collection = new Collection(products);\nconsole.log(`There are ${productCollection.count} products`);\n[...productCollection].forEach((p) =>\n  console.log(`Product: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`)\n);\n\nUsing index types\nTypeScript provides a set of related features that allow any property defined by an object to be used as a key while preserving type safety.\nIndex type query\nThe keyof keyword, known as index type query, returns a union of the property names of a type.\nlet myVar: keyof Product = \"name\";\nmyVar = \"price\";\nmyVar = \"someOtherName\";\n\nWill result in:\nsrc/index.ts(34,1): error TS2322: Type '\"someOtherName\"' is not assignable to type '\"name\" |\n\"price\"'.\nHow you can use it?\nfunction getValue(item: T, keyname: K) {\n  console.log(`Value: ${item[keyname]}`);\n}\nlet p = new Product(\"Running Shoes\", 100);\ngetValue(p, \"name\");\ngetValue(p, \"price\");\nlet e = new Employee(\"Bob Smith\", \"Sales\");\ngetValue(e, \"name\");\ngetValue(e, \"role\");\n\nNow getValue second parameter is protected from entering non-existing keys!\nExplicitly providing generic type parameters for index types\nExplicitly stating the type arguments reveals an aspect of using the index type query operator that can be confusing:\nfunction getValue(item: T, keyname: K) {\n  console.log(`Value: ${item[keyname]}`);\n}\nlet p = new Product(\"Running Shoes\", 100);\ngetValue(p, \"name\");\ngetValue(p, \"price\");\n\ngetValue(p, \"name\");\n\n                ^ Literal value type\n                            ^ value\nUsing the indexed access operator\nThe indexed access operator is used to get the type for one or more properties:\ntype priceType = Product[\"price\"];\ntype allTypes = Product[keyof Product]; // Union of all types for eg. string|number\n\nYou can get specific type by using square brackets []. For example, price might return a number type. When using a keyof inside such expression you'll get a union of all types string|number etc.\n\nAttention! The types returned by the indexed access operator are known as lookup types.\n\nThe indexed access operator is most commonly used with generic types, which allows property types to be handled safely even though the specific types that will be used are unknown:\nfunction getValue(item: T, keyname: K): T[K] {\n  return item[keyname];\n}\nconsole.log(getValue(p, \"name\"));\nconsole.log(getValue(p, \"price\"));\n\nThis way you can dynamically tell what type will be returned from the function!\nUsing an index type of collection class\nUsing an index type allows me to change the Collection class so that it can store any type of objects and not just those that define a name property.\nclass Collection implements Iterable {\n  private items: Map;\n  constructor(initialItems: T[] = [], private propertyName: K) {\n    this.items = new Map();\n    this.add(...initialItems);\n  }\n  add(...newItems: T[]): void {\n    newItems.forEach((newItem) =>\n      this.items.set(newItem[this.propertyName], newItem)\n    );\n  }\n  get(key: T[K]): T {\n    return this.items.get(key);\n  }\n  get count(): number {\n    return this.items.size;\n  }\n  [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator {\n    return this.items.values();\n  }\n}\nlet productCollection: Collection = new Collection(\n  products,\n  \"name\"\n);\nconsole.log(`There are ${productCollection.count} products`);\nlet itemByKey = productCollection.get(\"Hat\");\nconsole.log(`Item: ${itemByKey.name}, ${itemByKey.price}`);\n\nThe class has been rewritten with an additional generic type parameter, K, that is restricted to keyof T, which is the data type of the objects stored by the collection.\nCheat sheet for above code\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nT\nType of objects stored in the collection\n\n\nK\nKey property name (restricted by keyof T)\n\n\nT[K]\nType of the key property\n\n\npropertyName\nKey property name in JS` realm\n\n\n\nType Mapping\nMapped types are created by applying a transformation to the properties of an existing type.\ntype MappedProduct = {\n  [P in keyof Product]: Product[P];\n};\nlet p: MappedProduct = { name: \"Kayak\", price: 275 };\nconsole.log(`Mapped type: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`);\n\n\nType mapping works like a for in loop. It selects property names to be included in the mapped types and the type for each of them. In the example above it simply duplicates Product type.\n\nUsing generics in type mapping\ntype Mapped = {\n  [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n};\nlet p: Mapped = { name: \"Kayak\", price: 275 };\nconsole.log(`Mapped type: ${p.name}, ${p.price}`);\nlet c: Mapped = { name: \"London\", population: 8136000 };\nconsole.log(`Mapped type: ${c.name}, ${c.population}`);\n\n\nAttention: Mapping operates only on properties. When applied to a class, a type mapping produces a shape type\nthat contains properties but omits the constructor and the implementation of methods.\n\nclass MyClass {\n  constructor(public name: string) {}\n  getName(): string {\n    return this.name;\n  }\n}\n\nconst MappedClass: Mapped = new MyClass(\"gitarra\");\n\nWould generate following type:\n{\n  name: string;\n  getName: () => string;\n}\n\nType mapping produces shapes that can be used for object literals, implemented by classes, or extended by interfaces. Type mapping does not produce a class, however.\nChanging properties and mutability\nMapped types can change properties.\ntype MakeOptional = {\n  [P in keyof T]?: T[P];\n};\ntype MakeRequired = {\n  [P in keyof T]-?: T[P];\n};\ntype MakeReadOnly = {\n  readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n};\ntype MakeReadWrite = {\n  -readonly [P in keyof T]: T[P];\n};\n\ntype optionalType = MakeOptional;\ntype requiredType = MakeRequired;\ntype readOnlyType = MakeReadOnly;\ntype readWriteType = MakeReadWrite;\n\nSo they can be treated as helpers for creating new types.\nThere are built-in type mappings:\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nPartial\nThis mapping makes properties optional.\n\n\nRequired\nThis mapping makes properties required.\n\n\nReadonly\nThis mapping adds the read only keyword to properties.\n\n\nPick\nThis mapping selects specific properties to create a new type\n\n\nRecord\nThis mapping creates a type without transforming an existing one\n\n\n\nMapping Specific Properties\ntype SelectProperties = {\n  [P in K]: T[P];\n};\nlet p1: SelectProperties = { name: \"Kayak\" };\nlet p2: Pick = { name: \"Lifejacket\", price: 48.95 };\n\n\nAttention! In generic parameters' word extends means \"constrain\" not extend as it might be thought.\nNote: Type K can be expressed as a union.\n\nCombining Transformations in a Single Mapping\nMappings can apply multiple changes to properties.\ntype CustomMapped = {\n  readonly [P in K]?: T[P];\n};\ntype BuiltInMapped = Readonly>>;\nlet p1: CustomMapped = { name: \"Kayak\" };\nlet p2: BuiltInMapped = {\n  name: \"Lifejacket\",\n  price: 48.95,\n};\n\nMappings can also be chained together, as shown by the combination of the Pick, Partial, and Readonly mappings.\nCreating types with a type mapping\nYou can create a new type.\ntype CustomMapped = {\n  [P in K]: T;\n};\nlet p1: CustomMapped = { name: \"Bob\", city: \"London\" };\nlet p2: Record = { name: \"Alice\", city: \"Paris\" };\n\nBoth method are serving the same purpose.\nConditional types\nConditional types are expressions containing generic type parameters that are evaluated to select new types.\ntype resultType = T extends true ? string : number;\nlet firstVal: resultType = \"String Value\";\nlet secondVal: resultType = 100;\nlet mismatchCheck: resultType = \"String Value\";\n\n\nAttention! You should avoid complicated conditional types. If conditional type becomes more complex and encompasses more combinations, you should take a moment to consider if there is a simpler way to achieve the same result.\n\nNested conditional types\ntype references = \"London\" | \"Bob\" | \"Kayak\";\ntype nestedType = T extends \"London\"\n  ? City\n  : T extends \"Bob\"\n  ? Person\n  : Product;\nlet firstVal: nestedType = new City(\"London\", 8136000);\nlet secondVal: nestedType = new Person(\"Bob\", \"London\");\nlet thirdVal: nestedType = new Product(\"Kayak\", 275);\n\nNote: Wow! This is pretty f***d up.\nThe type nestedType is a nested conditional type to select between three result types, based on the value of the generic type parameter. As noted in the sidebar, complex conditional types can be difficult to understand, and this is especially true when they are nested.\nConditional types in generic classes\nConditional types can be used to express the relationship between a method or function’s parameter types and the results it produces. This is a more concise alternative to the function type overloading.\ntype resultType = T extends true ? string : number;\n\nclass Collection {\n  private items: T[];\n  constructor(...initialItems: T[]) {\n    this.items = initialItems || [];\n  }\n\n  total(\n    propName: P,\n    format: U\n  ): resultType {\n    let totalValue = this.items.reduce(\n      (t, item) => (t += Number(item[propName])),\n      0\n    );\n    return format ? `$${totalValue.toFixed()}` : (totalValue as any);\n  }\n}\n\nlet data = new Collection(\n  new Product(\"Kayak\", 275),\n  new Product(\"Lifejacket\", 48.95)\n);\n\nlet firstVal: string = data.total(\"price\", true);\n\nconsole.log(`Formatted value: ${firstVal}`);\n\nlet secondVal: number = data.total(\"price\", false);\nconsole.log(`Unformatted value: ${secondVal}`);\n\nLook at the total method. It has type check in return statement. That's because TypeScript cannot determine what type it will return.\nUsing Conditional Types with Type Unions\nConditional types can be used to filter type unions, allowing types to be easily selected or excluded from the set that the union contains.\ntype Filter = T extends U ? never : T;\n\nfunction FilterArray(\n  data: T[],\n  predicate: (item) => item is U\n): Filter[] {\n  return data.filter((item) => !predicate(item)) as any;\n}\n\nlet dataArray = [\n  new Product(\"Kayak\", 275),\n  new Person(\"Bob\", \"London\"),\n  new Product(\"Lifejacket\", 27.5),\n];\n\nfunction isProduct(item: any): item is Product {\n  return item instanceof Product;\n}\n\nlet filteredData: Person[] = FilterArray(dataArray, isProduct);\n\n// Person: Bob\nfilteredData.forEach((item) => console.log(`Person: ${item.name}`));\n\nWhen a conditional type is provided with a type union, the TypeScript compiler distributes the condition over each type in the union, creating what is known as a distributive conditional type. This effect is applied when a conditional type is used like a type union, like this, for example:\ntype filteredUnion = Filter;\n\nThe Filter conditional type evaluates to never when the first type parameter is the same as the second, producing this result:\ntype filteredUnion = never | Person;\n\nThe conditional type filters out any type that cannot be assigned to Person and returns the remaining types in the union. The FilterArray method does the work of filtering an array using a predicate function and returns the Filter type.\nUsing the Built-in Distributive Conditional Types\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nExclude\nThis type excludes the types that can be assigned to U from T\n\n\nExtract\nThis type selects the types that can be assigned to U from T\n\n\nNonNullable\nThis type excludes null and undefined from T.\n\n\n\n\nMore can be found in cheat sheet.\n\nUsing Conditional Types in Type Mappings\ntype changeProps = {\n  [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends U ? V : T[P];\n};\n\ntype modifiedProduct = changeProps;\n\nfunction convertProduct(p: Product): modifiedProduct {\n  return { name: p.name, price: `$${p.price.toFixed(2)}` };\n}\n\nlet kayak = convertProduct(new Product(\"Kayak\", 275));\nconsole.log(`Product: ${kayak.name}, ${kayak.price}`);\n\nThe changeProps mapping selects the properties of type U and changes them to type V in the mapped type. This statement applies the mapping to the Product class specifying that number properties should be made into string properties.\n\nBasically you can type a type converter this way.\n\nIdentifying Properties of a Specific Type\nA common requirement is to limit a type parameter so that it can be used only to specify a property that has a specific type.\ntype unionOfTypeNames = {\n  [P in keyof T]: T[P] extends U ? P : never;\n};\n\ntype propertiesOfType = unionOfTypeNames[keyof T];\n\nfunction total>(\n  data: T[],\n  propName: P\n): number {\n  return data.reduce((t, item) => (t += Number(item[propName])), 0);\n}\n\nlet products = [new Product(\"Kayak\", 275), new Product(\"Lifejacket\", 48.95)];\nconsole.log(`Total: ${total(products, \"price\")}`);\n// Total: 323.95\n\nThe conditional statement checks the type of each property. If a property doesn’t have the target type, then its type is changed to never. If a property does have the expected type, then its type is changed to the literal value that is the property name.\nFor the mapped type created by unionOfTypeNames, the indexed access operator [keyof T] produces the following union:\nnever | \"price\";\n\n\nAttention! Never is non-existent in union, so it's a clever way to remove something.\n\nInferring Additional Types in Conditions\nThere can be a tension between the need to accept a wide range of types through a generic type parameter and the need to know the details of those types.\nfunction getValue(data: T, propName: P): T[P] {\n  if (Array.isArray(data)) {\n    return data[0][propName];\n  } else {\n    return data[propName];\n  }\n}\n\nlet products = [new Product(\"Kayak\", 275), new Product(\"Lifejacket\", 48.95)];\nconsole.log(`Array Value: ${getValue(products, \"price\")}`);\nconsole.log(`Single Total: ${getValue(products[0], \"price\")}`);\n\n\nThis won't compile because compiler cannot correctly capture relation between the types.\n\nWhat can we do?\nWe can use the infer word to tell compiler to infer inner objects in an array.\ntype targetKeys = T extends (infer U)[] ? keyof U : keyof T;\n\nfunction getValue>(data: T, propName: P): T[P] {\n  if (Array.isArray(data)) {\n    return data[0][propName];\n  } else {\n    return data[propName];\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe effect is that the type of targetKeys and targetKeys both produce the \"name\" | \"price\" union.\n\nInferring types of functions\ntype Result = T extends (...args: any) => infer R ? R : never;\n\nfunction processArray any>(\n  data: T[],\n  func: Func\n): Result[] {\n  return data.map((item) => func(item));\n}\n\nlet selectName = (p: Product) => p.name;\nlet products = [new Product(\"Kayak\", 275), new Product(\"Lifejacket\", 48.95)];\nlet names: string[] = processArray(products, selectName);\nnames.forEach((name) => console.log(`Name: ${name}`));\n\nThe Result conditional type uses the infer keyword to obtain the result type for a function that accepts an object of type T and produces an any result.\nThe use of type inference allows functions that process a specific type to be used while ensuring that the result of the processArray function is a specific type, based on the result of the function provided for the func parameter.\nThe selectName function returns the string value of the name property of a Product object, and the inference means that Result string)> is correctly identified as string, allowing the processArray function to return a string[] result.\nThere are built-in conditional types (with inference)\n\n\n\nName\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nThis conditional type selects the types of each function parameter, expressed as a tuple.\n\n\nReturnType\nThis conditional type selects the function result type.\n\n\nConstructorParameters\nThe conditional type selects the types of each parameter of a constructor function, expressed as a tuple\n\n\nInstanceType\nThis conditional type returns the result type of a constructor function.\n\n\n\nThe ConstructorParameters and InstanceType are most useful when describing factory functions results.\nfunction makeObject any>(\n  constructor: T,\n  ...args: ConstructorParameters\n): InstanceType {\n  return new constructor(...(args as any[]));\n}\nlet prod: Product = makeObject(Product, \"Kayak\", 275);\nlet city: City = makeObject(City, \"London\", 8136000);\n[prod, city].forEach((item) => console.log(`Name: ${item.name}`));\n\n"},"type-script/full-tutorial/013-working-with-js.html":{"url":"type-script/full-tutorial/013-working-with-js.html","title":"013 Working With Js","keywords":"","body":"Working with JS\nSome useful compiler options:\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nallowJs\nAllow JS in compilation process\n\n\nbaseUrl\nRoot location used to resolve modules\n\n\ncheckJs\nCheck JS files for common errors\n\n\ndeclaration\nProduce type declarations\n\n\noutDir\nOutput directory\n\n\npaths\nLocations used to resolve module deps\n\n\nrootDir\nRoot directory to locate TS files\n\n\ntarget\nTargeted version of JS\n\n\n\nUsing JS with TS\nexport function sizeFormatter(thing, count) {\n  writeMessage(`The ${thing} has ${count} items`);\n}\nexport function costFormatter(thing, cost) {\n  writeMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);\n}\nfunction writeMessage(message) {\n  console.log(message);\n}\n\nAnd import:\nimport { sizeFormatter, costFormatter } from \"./formatters\";\n\nsizeFormatter(\"Cart\", cart.itemCount);\ncostFormatter(\"Cart\", cart.totalPrice);\n\nThis will throw an error:\ninternal/modules/cjs/loader.js:613\nthrow err;\n^\nError: Cannot find module 'dist\\index.js'\nSo, you need to enable allowJs in your tsconfig.json.\ncheckJs enabled\nIt will find error:\nsrc/formatters.js(6,60): error TS2554: Expected 0-1 arguments, but got 2.\n\nThis feature is useful only if you are able to modify the JavaScript files to address the problems the compiler reports.\n\nYou can enable or disable this feature per file using:\n// @ts-nocheck\n// @ts-check\n\nDescribing types used in JS code\nCompiler will try to infer types from JS but in most cases it will use any.\nexport function costFormatter(thing: any, cost: any): any {\n\nThis might also bring an error:\ncostFormatter(\"Cart\", `${cart.totalPrice}`);\n\nformatters.js:9: writeMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);\nTypeError: cost.toFixed is not a function\nUsing comments\nTypeScript can obtain types through JSDoc.\n/**\n* Format something that has a money value\n* @param { string } thing - the name of the item\n* @param { number} cost - the value associated with the item\n*/\nexport function costFormatter(thing, cost) {\nwriteMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);\n}\n\nYou can check how TS works with JSDoc here.\nUsing type declaration files\nTo describe types for formatters.js you must create a file formatters.d.ts.\nexport declare function sizeFormatter(thing: string, count: number): void;\nexport declare function costFormatter(thing: string, cost: number | string ): void;\n\n\nDeclaration files are more important than JSDoc comments.\n\nAttention!

This changes default types and combines multiple typings into one file (also adds support for static files like .svg etc.).\n\n\nLet's look into the SVG module:\ndeclare module \"*.svg\" {\n  import * as React from \"react\";\n  export const ReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent & { title?: string }\n  >;\n  const src: string;\n  export default src;\n}\n\n\nUse named exports because they're better with refactoring tools.\n\nStyling components\nYou can use external CSS files.\n\nIf you want to use style property, it's nice to put style into typed constant:\nimport React from \"react\";\nconst buttonStyles: React.CSSProperties = {\n  backgroundColor: \"#5aac44\",\n  borderRadius: \"3px\",\n  border: \"none\",\n  boxShadow: \"none\",\n};\n\nNotice: it will give you autocompletion.\n\nYou can use external styling libraries like StyledComponents.\npage. 49 (books)\n"},"type-script/fullstack-react-ts/BOOKMARKS.html":{"url":"type-script/fullstack-react-ts/BOOKMARKS.html","title":"BOOKMARKS","keywords":"","body":""},"type-script/classes.html":{"url":"type-script/classes.html","title":"Classes","keywords":"","body":"Classes\nTypeScript is more object-oriented than plain JavasCript. \nClass declaration\nThis is similar to C# and Java:\nclass HelloWorld {\n    text: string;\n\n    constructor(text: string) {\n        this.text = text;\n    }\n\n    output() {\n        console.log(this.text);\n    }\n}\n\nYou can also extend classes OOP way:\nclass TurboHello extends HelloWorld {\n    constructor(turbo: string) {\n        super(turbo);\n    }\n\n    turbo() {\n        console.log(this.text);\n    }\n}\n\nNotice: You need to call the super method to call the parent's constructor.\nAccessibility modifiers\nBy default each class member is public. This works like in any other language:\nclass HelloWorld {\n    private text: string;\n\n    constructor(text: string) {\n        this.text = text;\n    }\n\n    output() {\n        console.log(this.text);\n    }\n}\n\n"},"type-script/declaration-files.html":{"url":"type-script/declaration-files.html","title":"Declaration Files","keywords":"","body":"Declaration files\n\nYou can export types just as functions and variables.

So this example code won't cause any error:  \nlet isNew: boolean = null;\nlet myName: string = undefined;\n\nArray types\nTo declare an array with values of the same types:\n// Syntax 1\nlet list1: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n// Syntax 2\nlet list2: Array = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nTuple arrays\nTo declare a mixed array (tuple):\n// Mixed array - tuple\nlet person1: [string, number] = ['Satan', 666];\n\nEnum\nIs an array of predefined values:\nenum Color {Red, Green, Blue};\nlet c: Color = Color.Green; // value of 1 because it's second element\n\nenum Random {Kyle = 5, Satan = 666, Mark = \"Hamilton\"};\nlet n: Random = Random.Satan; // value of 666\n\nAny\nIf you can't predict the type of value you can use any. It works like in normal JS, you can define any other type of value to a previously declared variable.\nlet random: any = 10;\nconsole.log(random);\n\nrandom = 'ten';\nconsole.log(random);\n\nNotice: You should not overuse this type of variable because intellisense won't work with it.\nUnknown\nAn unknown is a special type of variable type for TypeScript. You can assign anything to it, but you can't use intellisense by default on such variables. You need to typecast them first:\nexport {}\nlet myVar: unknown = \"Lorem ipsum\";\n\n(myVar as string).toUpperCase();\n\nCustom object checking function\nBy using this function you can check if object of type unknown has a property called name:\nfunction hasName(obj: any): obj is { name: string } {\n    return !!obj \n        && typeof obj === \"object\" &&\n        \"name\" in obj;\n}\n\nif (hasName(myVar)) {\n    console.log(myVar.name);\n}\n\nNotice: !! operator is casting a value to boolean. Check this example:\nexport {}\nlet myVar: unknown = \"Lorem ipsum\";\nlet nothing: undefined = undefined;\n\n// True\nconsole.log(!!myVar);\n\n// False\nconsole.log(!!nothing);\n\nUnion of types\nYou can declare a variable with multiple possible types.\nlet multiType: number | boolean = true;\n\n// true\nconsole.log(multiType);\n\nmultiType = 666;\n\n// 666\nconsole.log(multiType);\n\n"}}}
