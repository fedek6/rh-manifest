# Typography

These are basic concepts of typography:
1. Legibility;
    - Upper case letters are considered more difficult to scan than lowercase;
    - A regular type is more legible than italics;
    - Good contrast increases readability, as does appropriate line length and height;
    - The upper half of a letter is more important for scanning.
2. Readability;
3. Measure (line length);
    - Optimal line length counts somewhere between 45 and 75 characters (spaces and punctuation included);
    - 66 chars are perfect line length;
    - Try to align text to the left.
4. Line height; 
    - Line height should be at least 150% (by average it measures 148%) of font size;
5. Tracking (letter-spacing);
    - Always check "AV", "ft", "co" and "vv - w" if using smaller kerning.
6. Word spacing;
    - Shorter lines warrant less word spacing;
    - Longer lines often benefit from more word spacing (especially if they have generous line-height).
7. Typographic color;
    - A block of text should have a uniform tone (if you squint and look at it on the screen);
    - Nothing should jump out it. If it does reading flow will be broken.

## General terms

* Accent is a diacritical mark near or through a letter for example "รณ";
* Axis is a real or imaginary line on which letterform rotates;
* Baseline is a line upon which the letters appear to rest;
* Bowls are round or elliptical forms that are the basic body shapes of letters, for example, C, G, O and b, c, e, or o;
* Cap height is the height of uppercase letters;
* Counter is the white space enclosed in a letterform;
* Crossbar is a horizontal stroke that connects two strokes in capital letters (H for example);
* Drop Cap is large initial capital in a paragraph; 
* Glyph is every character in the typeface;
* Ligatures are conjoined letters;
* Majuscule is a capital letter;
* Terminal is an end of a stroke that does not include serif;
* x-height is the height of the lowercase letters (exemplified by x).

## Tips and tricks

* Set font-size to 62.5% and you'll get one em amounting exactly 10px (it's easier to calculate);
* Use em units to calculate proportions between fonts;
* 30 to 50 ems can be seen as ideal line length;
* Always try to maintain a vertical rhythm. You can use this formula to calculate a heading line-height: basic line-height/heading font-size = heading line-height;
