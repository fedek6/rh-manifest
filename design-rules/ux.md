# UX rules

## Basics

* User interface design isn't about how a product looks but how it works;
* Firstly design interface, then code your backend;
* Clarity - good UI doesn't need manual;
* Concision - concise & clear at the same time;
* Familiarity - for example icons representing real-life objects; 
* Responsiveness - speed & feedback about application doings; 
* Consistency - use same patterns for the whole app;
* Efficiency - an app should make your users more efficient;
* Forgiveness - for example always show undo button.

## Building blocks of an interface

* Layout and positioning - make elements closer or further to show their's relationship. Position things properly, for example, labels on top of inputs are easier to read;
* Shape and size - Fitt's law tells us that bigger a clickable area is, the quicker users can move their mouse over it;
* Color;
* Contrast;
* Texture - you can use rough texture to indicate that something is draggable;

## Techniques for crafting effective interfaces

* Use white space to build relationships;
* Rounded corners better define boundaries;
* Convey meaning with color;
* Direct attention using color, animation or contrast;
* Shadow or blur backgrounds to show the importance of front actions; 
* Emphasize core actions - make primary buttons bigger or more visible. You can use not padded links for less important actions;
* Block links are more efficient;
* Use verbs as labels, for example, "Save changes" is way better than "OK";
* Focus on main input when in form view;
* Use hover on control rows;
* Use expanding forms when more records are added at once;
* Put labels inside inputs to declutter your UI;
* Hide advanced functionality; 
* Use icons - but not to much, select distinctive ones;
* Use loading indicators - an app is more responsive with them;
* Use pressed state in buttons - it shows your client that they clicked an element;
* Helpful blank states - when there's no data you can show information how to add something;
* Advertise features;
* Always add an accessible undo button after any operation; 
* Allow your clients to restore data;
* Show confirmation dialogs.
