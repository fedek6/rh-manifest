## Jacob's law

* Users will transfer expectations they have built around one familiar product to another that appears similar.

* By leveraging existing mental models, we can create superior user experiences in which the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning new models.

* When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.

Jacob's law doesn't force you to design the same webpage every time. Instead of that it reminds designers that users like to use their previous experiences in new environments. No one wants to learn new rules every time they try to make a grocery shopping.

Always start with a common patterns and update them only when it's meaningful. Test unconventional designs with your target group.
