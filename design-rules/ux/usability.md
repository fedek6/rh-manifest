# Usability 

```
Keep in mind that a designer's opinion is not (in most cases) your users' opinion.
```

* Users appreciate quality and credibility. Content is more important than the design that supports it. 

* Users don't read; they scan. When they analyze web page, they search for some fixed points or anchors that can guide them through content.

* Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification. The higher the cognitive load needed by users to process the website and less intuitive the navigation, the more likely they will leave you. 

* Users don't always make the best choices. Users choose whatever "satisfices" (satisfy + suffice). They choose the first reasonable option that presents itself. 

* Users follow their intuition. In most cases users will not read instructions. They will try to find something that works. 

* Users want to have control. They want to be able to control their browser and rely on consistently presented data. For example, they don't like popups, and they want to use "Back" button to return to a website that they just visited. 

## Use a Clean and Consistent Visual Design

You should create a website that looks great, and requires no brain to learn :)

## Certain elements belong in certain places

Websites should be designed like newspapers, users should predict where to find certain elements. 

### Example of common conventions

* Website's header is linked to the home page, and it's displayed in the top-left of a website. 

* Taglines or secondary headlines are usually located in a proximity to, and bellow, a website's header.

* Search boxes are located in the top-right or top-center of a website.

* If website as an RSS subscription, user will look for it in top-right of the page.
