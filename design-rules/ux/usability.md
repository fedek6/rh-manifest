# Usability 

```
Keep in mind that a designer's opinion is not (in most cases) your users' opinion.
```

* Users appreciate quality and credibility. Content is more important than the design that supports it. 

* Users don't read; they scan. When they analyze web page, they search for some fixed points or anchors that can guide them through content.

* Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification. The higher the cognitive load needed by users to process the website and less intuitive the navigation, the more likely they will leave you. 

* Users don't always make the best choices. Users choose whatever "satisfices" (satisfy + suffice). They choose the first reasonable option that presents itself. 

* Users follow their intuition. In most cases users will not read instructions. They will try to find something that works. 

* Users want to have control. They want to be able to control their browser and rely on consistently presented data. For example, they don't like popups, and they want to use "Back" button to return to a website that they just visited. 

## Use a Clean and Consistent Visual Design

You should create a website that looks great, and requires no brain to learn :)

## Certain elements belong in certain places

Websites should be designed like newspapers, users should predict where to find certain elements. 

### Example of common conventions

* Website's header is linked to the home page, and it's displayed in the top-left of a website. 

* Taglines or secondary headlines are usually located in a proximity to, and bellow, a website's header.

* Search boxes are located in the top-right or top-center of a website.

* If website as an RSS subscription, user will look for it in top-right of the page.

## Search must be easy

* A search box must be a box.

* There must be a button do perform search. 

* Advanced search options must be hidden.

* Search box should be placed on top–center or top–right part of your website — remember that users use the F shaped scanning pattern.

## Link rules

* Color is not enough to tell a user that something is a link — use also underlining. 

* Non-clickable elements never ever should look like links!

* Be consistent with styling links.

* Style different states of links. Users should know which are active, hovered and visited.

## Use drop-downs only when necessary

* Links in dropdowns have low visibility.

* When a drop-down menu has to many options, user need to scroll to what might interest him.

* Drop-down are not the first thing users intuitively look for as way to navigate. 

* Avoid more than one level of navigation!

__Notice__: mega drop-down menus work well. Consider them if you have a lot of navigation stuff on page.

## Add back to top link

Avoid polluting browsers history using this type of link. It should be purely JS solution without anchors!

## Avoid links in a new window

From a usability standpoint, forcing links to open in a new window violates one of the fundamental principles of UI design: users should always be in control of the interface.

## Useful navigation

Should have levels:

* Global navigation: moves you from section to section.

* Local navigation: moves you in the current section. This is a gateway to content.

* Contextual navigation: moves you in the current page (it's like a table of contents).

* Supplemental navigation: after exploring a page of your website, many users will visit another one. This type of navigation includes related content and invites readers to stay with you. This might also be a breadcrumb navigation — popular in e-commerce and complicated applications (this also may encourage users, that get to you using Google, to visit category view).
