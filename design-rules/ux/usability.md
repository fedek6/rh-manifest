# Usability 

```
Keep in mind that a designer's opinion is not (in most cases) your users' opinion.
```

* Users appreciate quality and credibility. Content is more important than the design that supports it. 

* Users don't read; they scan. When they analyze web page, they search for some fixed points or anchors that can guide them through content.

* Web users are impatient and insist on instant gratification. The higher the cognitive load needed by users to process the website and less intuitive the navigation, the more likely they will leave you. 

* Users don't always make the best choices. Users choose whatever "satisfices" (satisfy + suffice). They choose the first reasonable option that presents itself. 

* Users follow their intuition. In most cases users will not read instructions. They will try to find something that works. 

* Users want to have control. They want to be able to control their browser and rely on consistently presented data. For example, they don't like popups, and they want to use "Back" button to return to a website that they just visited. 

## Use a Clean and Consistent Visual Design

You should create a website that looks great, and requires no brain to learn :)

## Certain elements belong in certain places

Websites should be designed like newspapers, users should predict where to find certain elements. 

### Example of common conventions

* Website's header is linked to the home page, and it's displayed in the top-left of a website. 

* Taglines or secondary headlines are usually located in a proximity to, and bellow, a website's header.

* Search boxes are located in the top-right or top-center of a website.

* If website as an RSS subscription, user will look for it in top-right of the page.

## Search must be easy

* A search box must be a box.

* There must be a button do perform search. 

* Advanced search options must be hidden.

* Search box should be placed on top–center or top–right part of your website — remember that users use the F shaped scanning pattern.

## Link rules

* Color is not enough to tell a user that something is a link — use also underlining. 

* Non-clickable elements never ever should look like links!

* Be consistent with styling links.

* Style different states of links. Users should know which are active, hovered and visited.

## Use drop-downs only when necessary

* Links in dropdowns have low visibility.

* When a drop-down menu has to many options, user need to scroll to what might interest him.

* Drop-down are not the first thing users intuitively look for as way to navigate. 

* Avoid more than one level of navigation!

__Notice__: mega drop-down menus work well. Consider them if you have a lot of navigation stuff on page.

## Add back to top link

Avoid polluting browsers history using this type of link. It should be purely JS solution without anchors!

## Avoid links in a new window

From a usability standpoint, forcing links to open in a new window violates one of the fundamental principles of UI design: users should always be in control of the interface.

## Useful navigation

Should have levels:

* Global navigation: moves you from section to section.

* Local navigation: moves you in the current section. This is a gateway to content.

* Contextual navigation: moves you in the current page (it's like a table of contents).

* Supplemental navigation: after exploring a page of your website, many users will visit another one. This type of navigation includes related content and invites readers to stay with you. This might also be a breadcrumb navigation — popular in e-commerce and complicated applications (this also may encourage users, that get to you using Google, to visit category view).

## Important usability rules and principles

### 7±2 Principle

Human brain is limited in its capacity. It deals with complexity by dividing information into chunks and units. Humans can retain only about five to nine things in their short-term memory. This is an argument for limiting navigation items to seven (to 9). 

### 2-Second rules

User should not wait more than two seconds for response. The less users have to wait, the better will be the experience.

### 3-Click rule

Users stop searching if they aren't able to find it in three clicks. More clicks are OK if users always know where they are and where they can go.

### 80/20 Rule (Pareto)

80% of effects comes from 20% of causes. You can maximize your income if you identify the 20% of your most important users.

### Eight golden rules of interface design

1. Strive for consistency.
2. Allow frequent users to use shortcuts.
3. Offer informative feedback.
4. Design dialogs to yield closure. 
5. Offer simple error handling.
6. Permit easy reversal of actions.
7. Impart a sense of control. Support an internal locus of control.
8. Reduce short-term memory load.

### Fitts' Law

Time required to rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance to the target and the size of the target. The law claims that there is a speed-accuracy trade off associated with pointing, whereby target that are smaller/or further away require more time to acquire. The principle encourages content to be positioned in areas that maximize their accessibility and improve click rates.

### Inverted Pyramid

It puts summary at the very top of the article. It is essentially “waterfall effect”, well-known in journalism, whereby writers give their readers an instant picture of the topic they're reporting about. The article begins with the conclusion, followed by the key points and minor details, such as background information. Because Web users want instant gratification, it improves the user experience.

## Give Users a high view of your application

Let's look at some ways you can convey your website's goals.

### Mental models and metaphor

Mental model is a person’s thought of how something works.
Before they use a product, they imagine how to operate it according to their experience. And they use it based on that expectation. If the behavior of the product doesn’t meet the users’ mental model, it will confuse them. Therefore, we should design products to fit our user’s mental models.

There are two ways to have them match:

* Show the concept and features by metaphor. Metaphor in GUI is to use objects in the real world on software. For example, a screen looking like a bookshelf.

* Show the usage by idioms. Idioms in GUI are idiomatic expressions as visual language or patterns of interaction. For example, a list screen and its behavior. Clicking an item in the list takes users to the item’s detail screen. Many people can use this type of list screen because they have already learned this pattern.

__Notice__: Shopping cart is a metaphor — it's obvious that there's no real shopping cart behind the web app.

### Organize your website's content

A good place to start is with categorization, separating your content into semantically coherent groups. The ideal solution requires the least amount of overhead and is most useful to your users. To create a sensible categorization schema, develop a taxonomy based words and phrases that your audience would expect.

Another way to organize your content (and improve website's search results) is to make use of metadata.

### Offer a site map

For large websites, a map is a good way to orient users.
