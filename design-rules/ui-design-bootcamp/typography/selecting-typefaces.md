# Selecting typefaces

> Look for inspiration regularly! Good artists copy, great artists steal!

> Search Design Inspiration for a web typography!

## Define the brand 

* Write adjectives that describe best your brand (for e.g. fun, quirky, urban, familiar, dynamic, collaborative etc.).
* Find similar ones, decide which ones are better and remove those redundant. 
* Find only five unique ones, that are best describing your brand personality, and remove rest of them.

It's easier to create a design that communicates brand personality. It will be easier to convince your client to such project.

> Display is a special font designed for headings.

> Variable fonts have variable font-weight (you can adjust that from 1 to 999).

> Adobe has great font library.

## Body text

> Select your body typography first! Because it's the biggest part of your website.

> Search a font with a big x-height (readability). 

> Search a font with a lower contrast (Baskerville is bad, Playfair Display also).

> Body cannot have too much personality!

## How to find typefaces?

> You can create single typeface. But good headline gives you more possibilities. 


There two main font types for your project:

* Body text
* Display text

### Display text

Display text must drag user into rest of the content. 

> Heading must have personality! 

> Lack of good, original display typeface makes content dull & boring. 

> Display text is not about readibility, it's about branding and originality.

## Pairing 

> You can select third font for meta information (content heavy websites, more content hierarchy). For eg. Guardian website has captions under photography (smaller text, lighter color).

> Third font should be readable even if very small.
