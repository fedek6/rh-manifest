## Typeface or font?

Typeface - overall artwork.

Font - type of software (file).

Typography / typographic system - the art and decisions we make when laying on type.

Glyph - individual symbol in a font file

## Web typography

Do not use too much font files.

With the web we design the system before existing copy.

## Non-verbal communication

Some communication is non-verbal, but it's much less than 93%.

Typography is emotional communication.

We trust emotional communication more.

## Type anatomy
