# Pre-rendering and fetching

There are two types of pre-rendering in Next.js.

* Static generation - everything is built at compile and is always static;
* Server-side rendering - it generates HTML on each request.

You can create hybrid apps that use both of these methods.

### Static generation with data

It pulls data from the database or API and renders static HTML.
