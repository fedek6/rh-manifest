# Variable declaration

In `TypeScript` you should `const` and `let`, these statements support a block level and you cannot redeclare them.

__Notice:__ Let variables can be initialized without a value, const must have an initial value.

__Notice:__ If you know that a variable will not be redeclared, simply use a `const` statement.
