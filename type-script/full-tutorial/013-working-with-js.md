# Working with JS

Some useful compiler options:

| Option        | Description                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `allowJs`     | Allow JS in compilation process       |
| `baseUrl`     | Root location used to resolve modules |
| `checkJs`     | Check JS files for common errors      |
| `declaration` | Produce type declarations             |
| `outDir`      | Output directory                      |
| `paths`       | Locations used to resolve module deps |
| `rootDir`     | Root directory to locate TS files     |
| `target`      | Targeted version of JS                |

## Using JS with TS

```js
export function sizeFormatter(thing, count) {
  writeMessage(`The ${thing} has ${count} items`);
}
export function costFormatter(thing, cost) {
  writeMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);
}
function writeMessage(message) {
  console.log(message);
}
```

And import:

```ts
import { sizeFormatter, costFormatter } from "./formatters";

sizeFormatter("Cart", cart.itemCount);
costFormatter("Cart", cart.totalPrice);
```

This will throw an error:

```
internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:613
throw err;
^
Error: Cannot find module 'dist\index.js'
```

So, you need to enable `allowJs` in your `tsconfig.json`.

### `checkJs` enabled

It will find error:

```
src/formatters.js(6,60): error TS2554: Expected 0-1 arguments, but got 2.
```

> This feature is useful only if you are able to modify the JavaScript files to address the problems the compiler reports.

You can enable or disable this feature per file using:

```js
// @ts-nocheck
// @ts-check
```

## Describing types used in JS code

Compiler will try to infer types from JS but in most cases it will use `any`.

```ts
export function costFormatter(thing: any, cost: any): any {
```

This might also bring an error:

```ts
costFormatter("Cart", `${cart.totalPrice}`);
```

```
formatters.js:9: writeMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);
TypeError: cost.toFixed is not a function
```

### Using comments

TypeScript can obtain types through JSDoc.

```js
/**
 * Format something that has a money value
 * @param { string } thing - the name of the item
 * @param { number} cost - the value associated with the item
 */
export function costFormatter(thing, cost) {
  writeMessage(`The ${thing} costs $${cost.toFixed(2)}`, true);
}
```

You can check how TS works with JSDoc [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html).

### Using type declaration files

To describe types for `formatters.js` you must create a file `formatters.d.ts`.

```ts
export declare function sizeFormatter(thing: string, count: number): void;
export declare function costFormatter(
  thing: string,
  cost: number | string
): void;
```

> Declaration files are more important than JSDoc comments.

**Attention!** If `d.ts` file is used it must describe all features of a module. That's because it's only source of type information. TypeScript will see only described features of a module.

```
src/index.ts(3,40): error TS2305: Module '"/usingjs/src/formatters"' has no exported
member 'writeMessage'.
```

### Describing third-party JS code

Declaration files can also be used to describe JavaScript code added to the project in third-party packages that have been added to the project using NPM.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2018",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "allowJs": true,
    "checkJs": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "*": ["types/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

The paths property is used to specify locations that the TypeScript compiler will use as it tries to resolve import statements for modules. The configuration used in the listing tells the compiler to look for all packages in a folder called types.

**Important!** To provide the compiler with custom declaration files, the location specified by the `paths` folder must contain a folder that corresponds to the name of the module or package and must contain a type declaration file that corresponds to the packageâ€™s entry point, which is usually index.js, meaning that the declaration file is named index.d.ts. In the case of the debug package, this means the types used by the package will be described by the types/debug/index.d.ts file.

Example of handwritten delcaration:

```ts
declare interface Debug {
  (namespace: string): Debugger;
}
declare interface Debugger {
  (...args: string[]): void;
  enabled: boolean;
}
declare var debug: { default: Debug };
export = debug;
```

> Describing JS code this way is very complicated and should be avoided.

You can use `tsc --traceResolution` to know which files where used for typing compiled code.

There's official guide by Microsoft on how to write such declarations [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/introduction.html). But once again, don't do this!

### Definitely typed delcarations

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/debug
```

**Notice!** NPM will automatically select correct version of typings.

You need to disable `paths` option in `tsconfig.json` to enable definitely typed declarations.

> Compiler will search in `node_modules/@types` by default. 

### Packages with bundled types

It's easy to recognize. Simply check if there is a `index.d.ts` file in a package directory.

### Generating declaration files

You must disable `allowJs` to use this option. Simply set `declaration` to `true`.
