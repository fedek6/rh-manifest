# Data types

Usage of more complex data types.

## Arrays

TypeScript doesnâ€™t change the flexible sizing of arrays, but it does allow the data types they contain to be restricted through the use of type annotations.

```ts
let prices: number[] = [100, 75, 42];
let names: string[] = ["Hat", "Gloves", "Umbrella"];

prices.forEach((price: number, index: number) => {
  writePrice(names[index], calculateTax(price));
});
```

**Attention!** `forEach` callback is also typed. This is important because inner function needs these types.

**Attention!** You can use unions on arrays like this `(number | string)[]`.

---

There's alternative array syntax:

```ts
let test: Array<number> = [100, 200];
```

It cannot be used in a `tsx` files, so it's better to use standard syntax.

---

### Inferred array typing

You can accomplish exactly the same result without typing arrays. Simply check generated declaration files to see what's inferred.

Example output of a declaration file:

```ts
export declare const mixed: (string | number)[];
export declare const inferred: (string | number)[];
```

### Avoiding problems with inferred array types

The compiler infers array types using the values used to populate the array when it is created. This can lead to type errors if the values used to populate an array are accidentally mixed.

```ts
let prices = [100, 75, 42, "20"];
let names = ["Hat", "Gloves", "Umbrella", "Sunglasses"];
prices.forEach((price, index) => {
  writePrice(names[index], calculateTax(price));
});
```

This code will break because `string | number` is not assignable to `calculateTax` parameter which is a number.

**Attention!** Avoid using inferred array types, always use explicit typing.

### Empty arrays are problems

Another reason for using type annotations for arrays is that the compiler will infer the type any for arrays that are created empty.

If you don't use `noImplicitAny` empty array without typing will be inferred as `any`.

```ts
let prices = [];
prices.push(...[100, 75, 42, "20"]);
```

**Attention!** Always type empty arrays!

### Never array type pitfall

If you're using `noImplicitAny`, empty array will be `Array<never>` and you won't be able to add anything to it.

## Tuples

Tuples are fixed length arrays. They must be type annotated.

```ts
let hat: [string, number] = ["Hat", 100];
let gloves: [string, number] = ["Gloves", 75];
```

### Processing tuples

Tuples are standard JS arrays, so you can process them using array methods.

```ts
let hat: [string, number] = ["Hat", 100];
hat.forEach((h: string | number) => {
  if (typeof h === "string") {
    console.log(`String: ${h}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Number: ${h.toFixed(2)}`);
  }
});
```

### Using tuple types

Tuples have a distinct type that can be used just like any type, which means that you can create arrays of tuples, use tuples in type unions, and use type guards to narrow values to specific tuple types.

```ts
let products: [string, number][] = [
  ["Hat", 100],
  ["Gloves", 75],
];
let tupleUnion: ([string, number] | boolean)[] = [
  true,
  false,
  hat,
  ...products,
];

tupleUnion.forEach((elem: [string, number] | boolean) => {
  if (elem instanceof Array) {
    elem.forEach((tupleElem: string | number) => {
      if (typeof tupleElem === "string") {
        console.log(`String Value: ${tupleElem}`);
      } else {
        console.log(`Number Value: ${tupleElem}`);
      }
    });
  } else if (typeof elem === "boolean") {
    console.log(`Boolean Value: ${elem}`);
  }
});
```

## Enums

Enum is a collection of elements that for readability can be used by names.

```ts
enum Product {
  Hat,
  Gloves,
  Umbrella,
}
let products: [Product, number][] = [
  [Product.Hat, 100],
  [Product.Gloves, 75],
];

products.forEach((prod: [Product, number]) => {
  switch (prod[0]) {
    case Product.Hat:
      writePrice("Hat", calculateTax(prod[1]));
      break;
    case Product.Gloves:
      writePrice("Gloves", calculateTax(prod[1]));
      break;
    case Product.Umbrella:
      writePrice("Umbrella", calculateTax(prod[1]));
      break;
  }
});
```

### How Enums work?

Each Enum element simply has numeric value.

```ts
[Product.Hat, Product.Gloves, Product.Umbrella].forEach((val) => {
  console.log(`Number value: ${val}`);
});
```

```
Number value: 0
Number value: 1
Number value: 2
```

```ts
enum Product {
  Hat,
  Gloves,
  Umbrella,
}
let productValue: Product = 0;
let productName: string = Product[productValue];
```

### Using specific Enums

By default, TypeScript uses numeric zero-based values. You can tweak that:

```ts
enum Product {
  Hat,
  Gloves = 20,
  Umbrella,
}
```

Means:

```ts
declare enum Product {
  Hat = 0,
  Gloves = 20,
  Umbrella = 21,
}
```

**Warning!** Compile can duplicate values and overwrite them this way.

You can also evaluate Enum values:

```ts
enum OtherEnum {
  First = 10,
  Two = 20,
}
enum Product {
  Hat = OtherEnum.First + 1,
  Gloves = 20,
  Umbrella = Hat + Gloves,
}
```

**Attention!** These features can be useful, but close attention is required to avoid accidentally creating duplicate values or unexpected results. Keep Enums simple and leave the compiler to generate numbers wherever possible.

### Using string Enums

An Enum can contain both string and number values, although this is not a feature that is widely used.

```ts
enum City {
  London = "London",
  Paris = "Paris",
  NY = "New York",
}
console.log(`City: ${City.London}`);
```

### Be careful with Enums

```ts
let productValue: Product = 0;
```

This won't be an error, event if there is no `Product` with `0` key.

Also, you won't be able to type guard an Enum:

```ts
let productValue: Product = Product.Hat;
if (typeof productValue === "number") {
  console.log("Value is a number");
}
let unionValue: number | Product = Product.Hat;
if (typeof unionValue === "number") {
  console.log("Value is a number");
}
```

### Constant Enums

**Attention!** This is an advanced feature that is rarely required in most projects. Performance is faster in constant Enums.

Simply add `const` keyword:

```ts
const enum Product { Hat, Gloves, Umbrella }
let productValue = Product.Hat;
```

You won't be able to use this code:

```ts
const enum Product { Hat, Gloves, Umbrella}
let productValue = Product.Hat;
let productName = Product[0];
```

Will give: 

```
A const enum member can only be accessed using a string literal.
```
