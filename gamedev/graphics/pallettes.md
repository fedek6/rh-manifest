# Color palettes

## Aseprite

* `H` (hue) is color.
* `S` (saturation) is amount of the color.
* `V` (vibrance) is balance between white and black.

## Decision on saturation

1. High saturation means fun â€” that's why Mario games use them (kids toys etc.).
2. Low saturation is more gloomy and serious.

__Notice__: In Aseprite you can mark two colors and generate gradient between them.
